How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
How do you get your hair to look like that?
She's not a...
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Did you change your hair?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
Why didn't you tell me?
That's not
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Let go!
I just wanted --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Daddy, I --
Wear the belly before you go.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
No, but
I'm missing something.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Get out!
That I'm used to.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
He's pretty!
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What'd you do to her?
What's the worst?
Hey -- do you mind?
Two legs, nice rack...
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
William didn't even go to high school
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Why'd you let him get to you?
Were you in jail?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Wholesome.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Put your right foot there --
The Partridge Family?
Yes
Then you screwed up
Is that a request or a command?
That ' s completely adorable!
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
As a parent, that's my right
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Which parts?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
You think?
Kat a fan, too?
What plan?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
You were right. She's still pissed.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
We should have seen land.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
How far from here?
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
... and also to bring medicine.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
How can you be so certain?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
All of them!  Just lies!
I am listening, my son.
New worlds create new people.
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
You must be mad...!
We're lost!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
What are you asking me?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
What are you doing?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Are you hit?
Who's there?
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Hmmmm.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Stop it.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
So what's unique?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Okay.  You ready?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Whore?
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
We spent it!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
I speak English.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
No.  Go ahead.
I'll send a cop back for you.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Really.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
It's the last one.
I guess not.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
CONINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Oh, thank you very much.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I understand.
Name?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Hey, what about me?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
This prison gives out $400 suits?
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
No way to start a partnership.
Yeah.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I don't give out the details.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
You made that move, huh?
Half a million.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
What about Luther?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Do I get to kiss her too?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
That's what you say, Cates...
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Hey, I don't believe it.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
How do you know?
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Hard man to live with.
How ya doin'?
Surprise, Luther.
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
How you doing, man?
What're you laughing about?
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Leeloo's in trouble?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Where's Leeloo?
Leeloo... is... she's...
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Don't you open your messages?
I'm not going.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Apipoulai!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
You get that off the screen?
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
...Like love...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Talk English Doc.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Staedert, do you read me?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Drink!
...Not far, now.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
What?
Anything harder?
Snuff?
What do you want?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
A fellow investor.
That's five thousand dollars.
I want to watch you work.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You brought the money?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
Alright, Tom.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Celebrity Films.
What?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You're asking me why?
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Truman Capote.
How long you been working there?
Not quite.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
How old are you?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Wha... ?
What's this?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
You don't have any other choice.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Okay.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I remember.  You just left...
Yes... I remember Mary
Her belongings?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Rick...I can't.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
I can't go back to sleep again.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
No...
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
You just feel sorry for me.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Here we are.
You look great!
Hey, Rick!
So?
What's wrong with me?
Something wrong with the stairs?
What is it?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
How was the meeting?
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
What's that got to do with it?
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
What?
But how are we gonna --
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Vomit?
How is he - ?
My father!  He's not - ?
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Reef!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
All ready?
What do you think?
Right <u>at</u> him?
He did!
Why?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Are you alright, Wade?
Who?
Yes.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
I'm okay.
Safety on?
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
No brag. Just fact.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Where'd you get the blood?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Open the door. We're late.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Yeah.
Was it funny?
No what?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
It's pretty old.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
On what you pay me?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Want to buy?
No problem. Look, I...
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
You don't mean that.
Alright. I'll think about it.
I know your parents.
Of course! I would've heard.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Something about my father?
Take care, Wade.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
The other guy.
Where's Ma?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Well, it was an accident.
Get some sleep.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Find them everywhere.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
There they are!
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Uh, we got a problem here.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Why?
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Finally, we can bargain.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
May I speak to you for a moment?
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
Where's my family?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
What?
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Forget it.  I was reading.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
Elaine, what's going on?
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
You mean...
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Ted, the lever!
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
You folks need any help?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
See them, Elaine?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
He's right on the heading.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Roger.
Excuse me, Sister?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
Kill them both.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Stop the car.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
How potent?
We?  You've taken it?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Okay, let's do it.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Amy.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
No.  There's no way!
That's right.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Now, wait a second --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
One of us?
So.
How do you feel?
What's the question?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Seventeen meters.
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
It's inside the complex.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Nine meters.  Eight.
So what do I tell this guy?
I don't want you for a friend.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
No, it's different, honey.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Burke!  Open the door!
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Where?
Oh!
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What does he look like?
What did you think of the music?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
What?
Oh - excuse me!
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
No! I won't have him back.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
You have leave to try.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Stop it!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, I'm not playing this game.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Wolfi!
Yes, my love?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Frau Mozart?
Then he didn't send you?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Alone.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Behold!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
What a strange young man.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
A-flat, Majesty.
My pleasure.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Why so?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Would you tell me why?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Yes, sir.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Yes.
No, really!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Where does he work?
Where?
Sssh!
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Yes.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
I'm sorry. No.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Really? Why?
With all my heart, Mozart.
But what is it they don't like?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
You flatter me.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
How long will you give me?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Would you? Actually, you could.
Where did I stop?
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
With the tenors.
You mean in Turkey?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Who is on this committee?
Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Leave me alone.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Are they?
Where?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
What?
Yes.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Ballet? What ballet?
Here I am, my angel.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Herr Salieri.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
How did he look?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes.
He's here.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
It wasn't a lunatic.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Now what do you want to talk about?
What? Oh, yes, please.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
I'm a werewolf.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
The bedroom.
Anything.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
I looked.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
I really don't know.
Jack.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
Did you hear that?
A coyote.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
It's moving.
Nice to see you.
Thanks a lot.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
Jack, are you really dead?
What can I say, Jack?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
What can we do to assist you?
What here?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Sorry, love.
Remember the Alamo?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Oscar, what's the matter?
Where's Matt?
He has?
About twenty-four thousand.
I remember once when your account checked.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
We want to talk to you.
Say, you can't do that
Oh!
Thanks.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
What do you mean?
know, but
Doesn't that come next?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
Well, what?
No.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Cyril, you're insane
Let me see your cash book, will you?
I'm not interested in what you think.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Mr. Dickson?
You haven't got a uniform?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Absolutely.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Yes.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He was in the bank yesterday.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
Then who changed it?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
How are you fixed?
Where's Charlie?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
He's smiling.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
The Army can hang him.
How many of them did he kill?
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
A bad idea.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
I think one of 'em's glass.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Jesse.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
What the --
Where the hell were you?
You know you're welcome any time!
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Distracting enough for you?
Hell of a war.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
You know him?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
How much of that story is true?
You're sick of my company?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Hmm.
Let me see that.
Did you order our houses burned down?
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
You okay, Jesse?
Well, not exactly.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Really!
With my money!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
That.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
You wouldn't have done that?
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
On a lot of lithium?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Yes?
Uh huh.
Pick me up?
Pull out.
It's a plain end, see? So?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Yes, darling?
We should do it.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Are you using minoxidil?
You're really serious, aren't you?
But what about the past? Our past?
No, no, no.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Doesn't he live here?
Are you sure?
Patrick? Is that you?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
What's that, a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
We are totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh? And what should I say?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
I'll do it.
Jean?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Do you have a boyfriend?
Jean? What?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
So, what do you do?
Well...
Yeah.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Coffee?
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Your address?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
Where did Paul hang out?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
That's so typical, isn't it?
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I mean they want to get caught.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Well, I could he wrong.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Speak up. Come on.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Is that a raincoat?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
You don't wanna move, do you?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
That was -- different.
Look at this.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
My goodness.
You're interfaced with our dish.
That's gotta kill him, right?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Had you talked to him much lately?
You've been coming in early.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I think you should go.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
What're we looking for?
What've you got there?
Cool!
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
I snuck into #21.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Why were you snooping in my office?
Thank God.
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Latitude 47 degrees.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
What're they building?
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Hungry.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Yes?
When do I begin?
Thank you, Basil.
Yes?
Hello, Exposition.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
What's wrong with your hand?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
I hate having my picture taken.
Why?
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't. You're drunk.
I love you, Austin.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Noooooooooooooo!
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Ow! You shot me!
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Hi.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
Umm, that also has already happened.
How's Austin?
You didn't...
I'm proud of you.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
Did you ever...
What do you want to do, Scott?
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Hope...
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
You are female?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
How curious ...
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Much better.
But why? What's the point?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Is that what you think?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
You're playing games.
No, after you.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Mrs. Peel?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Think she really killed those agents?
Insane ... ?
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
In your operation.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
You're kidding.
What?
All right!
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I don't want any trouble.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Hello?
Fine. How's everything going?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
No, Cole, I...
God, you're a slob.
What are we having?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Huh? Wha...
That feels so great.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Great bathing suit.
Your whores never showed up.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Is that all the coke in the place?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
It's on the tenth floor.
Feel free.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Where'd she go?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
I'm not really hungry.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
You're late again, Rick.
Wash it to the windows?
Biggest in two battalions.
-- He killed people --
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
...Not now, Brian.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
How do you know?
-- What were they doing there?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Huh.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Brian. What's wrong?
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
I'm sorry.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Are you still here?
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Your brother was a good man.
Four months?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
So, you surviving without me?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Firehouse.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
He just wants to --
Where's Sean?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
He treats you okay?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Got a cause?
Don't you have any leads at all?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
People.
So what are you doing here?
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
How's the case going?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Everybody say Ho!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Well you did.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
What do you do?
What's wrong with him?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Nice to meet you.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
But the line has to be drawn.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I'm feelin' dis'!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
I love you too, Daddy.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
He never showed it.
You've said that already.
Same here.
So you have your small victory, now what?
Is that good or bad?
How so?
Why'd you do that?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
This is crazy.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Can I kiss you too?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
No.
Where are you from?
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...then what about...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
What else?
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
Good day to you, young sir.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I have no luggage.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
For whom else have you worked?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Then you yield to me.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I feel the ribbon.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Does this assignment interest you?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Papa?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Dark Valdez.
I don't want to go --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
You did Basic here?
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Some.
We're not finished yet --
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Back up.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
So you killed him?
Roberto, what the fuck?
You know it's not like that --
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Bullshit.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
His chest was hamburger --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
What happened to "degrees"?
How do you know?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
How are you?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Hostile and uncooperative.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Baseball?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
Something wrong?
That was kid gloves?
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Are you sure?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Hardy, what are you doing --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
This isn't the time --
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Pike and I got separated --
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
What happens to Dunbar now?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Someone stole my backpack.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Then do it.
You get the eye?
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Will.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Well, she... uh...
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
So I've heard.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Spooning the sherbet.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
You don't like it?
Okay.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
She was a witch.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
When did you ever work in an office?
I thought you weren't dying.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Tell me how it happens.
It's unbelievable.
I'm sorry.
Daffodils?
How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.
I was drying out.
I don't believe it!
How did you know my father?
I'm going to check on him.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Mmm.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
What happened?
How did you get here?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Is he awake?
You first.
You know what for.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
It's enough isn't it?
Yes.
What? What are you doing?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Hello.
And...
So how long will you be in England?
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
I...
Tell me.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
How is bank?
Oh Jesus.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
They go. John. They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
In the world.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Excuse me?
And? What are you saying?
And who says what is wrong.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes which?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I got what I paid for.
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
I don't have nothing.
Are you scared?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Nobody's that unhappy.
You know you can come under the blanket.
Why?
It's a long way to go for a date.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Is the flight full?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
This was very sweet of you.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Hi.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
For your hands?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
What happened?
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Let me say somethin' first...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
LET ME GO!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
How you feelin' today?
I know that.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
You get a call from Rose?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Heard about this morning.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
You a preacher?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Some party.
Let's go.
This should be it...
You cool, Ich?
Why the hell not?
You must leave?
Did I say that?
What's in the box?
Nick, you can't do this.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Joyce?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't give him any more.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
You'll get Ich killed.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
I still think you're a bastard.
Might be different in New York.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
One guy do all the damage?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
What's the problem?
I want more life, fucker.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Show me something?
You could help us.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
You got a machine on it yet?
I was just about to have my dinner.
She was gonna get away.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
You start.
Yes?
Not if it works.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Next.
Number three.
Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
I like you.
One more, eh?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Nerves of steel.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
You're going to be over the limit.
What if you change your mind?
My job is here.
Taffey Lewis?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Are you for real?
What the fuck for?
The best.
Are you apprehensive?
I'd take him to the doctor.
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
I told you I'd come back.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
This feels stupid.
Uh-huh.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
You want to go home?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Bravo!
My office.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
Please excuse this interruption.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Nope.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
And that's it?
It's Perry!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Watching television in color.
...Okay.
Why not go to work for me?
What's fair?
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Because I want to get married.
I didn't know that.
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
When do you need her by?
Stop that ma'am crap!
You almost got us killed!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Where's he gone?
He has a computer?
May I please be excused?
That's ridiculous.
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
No.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Is that a birthday cake?!
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Are you all right?
I've got to go, now.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Like a painting?
Like one of Mom's?
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
But, I don't understand.
You're sure?
Right on the button.
When did we get it from them?
This must be very new.
It's so small.
Yes. He likes windows.
Why not? He has great pants.
The recovery is very impressive.
Why did you park way back there?
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
The hotel.
How old are you?
I don't see anything!
Help you?
Say what?!
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Well, where are you --
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Oh, no.
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
How long will you set it for this time?
What are you bitching about now?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
What's that mean?
What's it to you?!
What?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Where did he get all that information?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Is Sandy part of this?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
THEN WHAT?
Sure I'm alright.
Thank you. honey.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Then don't talk about killing.
Hi, can I come in?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Bull.
He's comin' back? What for?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hey? You like to walk.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Well.
Hi Dad.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
So, what's next?
You really want to do this, don't you?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah, but.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
Did you see her undressed?
Who, me? Why should it?
What am I going to do?
Jeffrey!!
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
You want to dance?
Probably not. No. Why?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Fuck you.
I need Il Duce.
Yes sir.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What?
You think they sold me out? No way.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
Shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Hello.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
Yeah, we promise.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Would someone please come over here and...
Hey Murphy?
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
I don't know they just always need it.
Is that right, Rambo?
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
Give the guy a shot.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
Now, you will receive us.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
And number three, Dolly.
So, what do we do now?
She was in here when it went down.
They were wearing masks.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
What the...?
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
No. You sure you're okay?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Has he now?
I guess not.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
What does Starsky say?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
See if mine are in there.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Obviously. That's a given.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Where was I?
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I'm not. But there's --
I had to give some to Inez.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Mark that down.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
What's happening? What's going on?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
There's not enough time.
You got to be kidding me.
No. I'm not.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Are you afraid?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Are you serious?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Give him a second.
You OK, Bob?
Yeah.
How do you say nineteen?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
That's Anthony.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Did we get it?
How much is there?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
The weed.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
I know it's not.
Bob, you're lying!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I couldn't hear anything.
What's wrong with Applejack?
The elevator broke.
Do you have your own room?
Do you have your own cell?
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
How long do you have to go?
What do you mean grammar?
Join the party, fellas.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
What's the story?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Let's talk about Conklin.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Excuse me.
May I finish?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
That's not what happened to your parents.
Front. Use your teeth.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Who sent you to Greece?
I'll get the book.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
Where --
You drive.
I did.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Say it.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Why am I alive?
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
How long have you worked for the agency?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Good luck.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
What are they doing?
But... what will you do?
Young Robert, we are honored --
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
He won't come.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
What is it?!
When will his trial be?
The Bruce is not coming, William.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
You'll move
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Where is my son?
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Thank you for accepting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I've missed you.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I need you so much! I love you!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
I am the Princess of Wales.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
Why did you?
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Please, mom. People will talk.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
So how's Tommy?
Not if you remember my dad.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
There's one major hole in your story.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
What time is it?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What the hell are you doing?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
Shut up, Tommy!
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, I'll bet.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Goodnight.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Do you know where they are?
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Yes?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
But why my name, Richard?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Our faithful friend is still there.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Ask me?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
Had a close one, eh?
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
But we made a deal.
Yes.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No, Captain, please.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
And that is?
Even in Berlin.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Oh, but I just told you. --
This is the end of the chase.
He is traveling with a lady.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Yeah, you were saying?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Uh huh.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Are my eyes really brown?
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
He'll double what I pay you.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Nobody remembers that.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Jesus.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
You know what happened to this?
Sonofabitch!
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Hey, look at you.
You know, for when you travel.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I would never --
There was a coffin?
What was inside?
Come on.  Try.
This is so unfair.
I love you, Chuck.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
I am one lucky guy.
Yes, yes he did.
But chickens?
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
How'd it go?
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
You were how long on this?
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
What, then?
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Only if you can afford it.
He'll need clothes... some money...
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
These *credentials* are against the law!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
What's she so emotional about?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
What's the *medical* explanation?
You don't miss it?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
"...did." Well, okay.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
That's a heavy sedation.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
At what altitude?
They're migrants.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
It looks like scurvy.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I don't think so.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
But you don't look very happy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Where do you think you're going?
Silicon Valley?
Can --
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
This has to happen fast.
So how'd you get caught?
But there were other factors.
Nice.
Like what?
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Who's that?
Whoa. What?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Shit.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Why?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Listen, Scooter --
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
What -- What do we do?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
I don't trust anyone.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Look at you... You want to go.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you know I will?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
How do you deal with --
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Uh...
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
What'd he say?
What happened?
Sorry. What?
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
So what do you want?
Ten percent.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Speak.
Did he buy it?
What are you doing?
I got scared.
The Indian rope-trick.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What kind of deal you looking to?
She went back to South Africa.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
I found her in bed with someone.
I get it.
Good night?
How's that football story corning along?
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
I had training. In the Republic.
What's the time?
How did it go?
I loved it blond.
Are you drunk?
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Here...use a spoon.
What?
Great.
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
Near the casino.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
He doesn't gamble.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
They mean it.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
And I thought you were only after my body.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
Jani! Where are you?
How are you?
Did you solve your problems?
I'm Lucy.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
What are you, a cop?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Hey Jack, join us.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
Where's the magnet?
Ever?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
You can start Monday week.
That hair will have to go.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Where is the key?
What was that, I didn't hear...
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Well of course I exist.
And you can only do it once, right?
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
In a second.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
Oh yeah?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
How're ya doin', Max.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
What a creep.
I know.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
No...
What makes you cry?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Girlfriend?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Well, not me personally.
What's this?
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Know where I can find her?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
This is not a place you wanna go.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
A long time.
So are dogs.
Not right now.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
What happens if you level with her?
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She was the one--
What the hell is that?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
What's that?
Sorry.
Jeremiah?
We've got to take this slow...
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Shit, that dork is Jam.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Could be.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Ahh, sunshine.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Mom, what're we...?
No.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Well? Continue! Continue!
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Simplicity, Hawk.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Two hundred bucks?
I don't even think you have a gun!
Are you AFRAID?
What happened?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
I want to show you something.
What happened to your eye?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
Hey...
Wow. Did he go to jail?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Where are we going?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
That's alright... I understand.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Will you please talk to me?
My mom is gone.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Is that a cellar door?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
So how was school today?
Grandma Death.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Cellar door.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
So, I met a new friend.
Don't you watch the news?
Do you think a lot about girls?
Who is the boss?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
People get hurt.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
I think now that he might...
Because I'm so horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Our son just called me a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Christ. Is that an axe?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
So, what do I say?
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
You-betcha.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Oh, Amber...
Amber? Here.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Oh shit!
Bye mom.
I hate her!
This, this... This is bullshit!
What're you doin' here?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Okay... well, bye.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Okay?
The bitch.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
This is -- what?
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
What's the matter with you?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Half watch dog?
What do you whistle?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You no gotta no gun.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight...
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Anything else?
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
That's what you think.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
What'll I do with this card?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Uncle, you can't do this!
One or two?
Did it go well, darling?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Don't!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
This man belongs in hospital.
I want my man back.
I want him back!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
Has the response picked up?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
...Yyes
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
...Yes potatoes... but...
The hospital?
You look splendid, John.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You did this for me?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Watery headed bunch.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's your fantasy...
WHAT did you say?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
No!
Erik. You don't understand.
The second note.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
Would you like us to sing to you?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
No.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
I'll tell you what...
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
I don't suppose... no...
About NOT raping you...
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Let's hack her to pieces.
That's terrible!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We're missing all the fun...
Slower! In... Out...
What did he say?
You must help us.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
What's the matter with them?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I know. I know.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Well! Come on!
What?
Get away, Snorri.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Together we stand!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Help!
Made by YOU, Loki!
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me that later.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
And I just liked you so much.
No, it was lovely.
Ms. Kruczynski?
You rat.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
It's okay, really.
Really? Because --
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
I can't remember.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
I'm sure you would.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
It's okay.
I'm not a stalker.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Um --
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Let's talk about it later.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You're drunk.
I want to know you.
Such a beautiful view.
Oh?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
It's very late.
I told her today I need to end it.
Yeah?
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Probably.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I wish we did. You married?
I knew.
What if you stay this time?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What took you so long?
Hi, it's Joel.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
I don't know. Panties and --
I just got in.
That's me.
It was snowing.
It's them.
Clementine.
She's so sexy.
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Yours?
So what's going on, Joel?
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
See you later, alligator.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
He's coming?
And after that?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Mary...
Order me a pastrami for after?
Okay, we're back in.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
You made me have an abortion.
Stan? What's going on?
It's an apartment.
Yeah?
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But I don't know how to polka.
Is everything getting worse?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
You don't?
Where are the others?
Tell me about it.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
I'm cold.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Hitchhiking?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
We have a man down...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
You weren't there. I saw it.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Is that an offer?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
How is he?
Do you hear it? Right there.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
Does he know that?
What, Justin, what shows you?
...I don't want to die...!
Peters is right, no one's here.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Any survivors?
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
What about my ship?
You can't leave. She won't let you.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
What are you?
Jesus...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
That's an affirmative.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Oxygen is not the problem.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Miller, come in...
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
First time in a grav couch?
He served on the Goliath.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
We have to do something, oh God...
You got any coffee?
Where is she?
What?
A straight line.
What is it?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Where is Reed?
Ben?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Isn't that your speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
We had a tough year.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey! That's a prototype!
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
You're hot!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Back it down, Johnny!
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Stop it.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Then what is it?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
For science.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Ben's still out there --
Ben did this?
But I'm not done with the machine --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What's going on?
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
How much did they cost?
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
You are a virgin!
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Do you have any ice tea?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Are you really a virgin?
What's wrong?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Yo.
Did you go home and get it?
Well, I've gotta be running.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
He is.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
How's it going.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
What do you think?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Can I come in?
I couldn't make it in time.
What's that?
Thanks for picking me up.
How about the point?
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
This is a nice car.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Hi, Mark.
Really?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Rum and ice, please.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Where's the medicine?
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
What are you talking about?
That's what gives me The Fear.
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Jesus.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
The cops?
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
Adrenochrome...
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
The airport is over there!
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
Could I have that, please?
You realize...
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
What?
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Stop!
Careful.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Stop it.
I think I know where a CB is.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
What tunnel? Where?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
Where's the tunnel?
Ohhh.
We're better off.
Why do you take shit from him?
Your brother, huh?
We gotta be close.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Oh, no.
Really?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
Huh?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What do you mean what?
How many?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Bullshit.
Move it!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Hurry!
Yeah, maybe.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Yeah, I'll go.
What's wrong?
Okay, well that's something.
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Go! Go!
Get to your cars!
Oh my God... What is that?
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
You know you don't have to do this.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Did we make it?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
I guess so, sir.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Hello, Harold.
Who?
Get your clothes on, lady --
Without me.
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...Don't you?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
...So what do you think?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Bread?
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
See you next weekend?
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
You sound as if you hate it.
What?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
What?
Oh no...
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I'll bet.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Where are we, mean man?
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
To quarter-horses.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
And no people.
Where you goin'?
Yeah.
I'm not!
How's it sound?
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
At one. Promise?
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Yes...?
...Did you really say that?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Is there something else?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
What?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
It can't be as bad as that.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What can I do?
This was not taken from a grave.
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
It's going to ram us.
I am not mad.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
They just caught the man who did it.
That's blasphemy!
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
I have always loved him.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Melvin Belli.
You draw very well.
Any particular reason?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
How come you're leaving?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
I'll go check on Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
What's the matter with it?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
You said we were special.
I wouldn't know.
Claudette...
Thanks.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Roll him over!
You just had some lucky shots.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
I love you.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Looks like a storm.
It's just a dream.
Are you wet?
How much do I owe you?
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Why do you want to stop?
What are you gonna do?
What about Kate?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
You don't believe in suicide.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
How'd she die?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
What are you going to do?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
Not good enough, swear to God.
What's going on?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Creepy guy.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
-- see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Not even for lunch?
I never said help us!
Best in Mexico.
Start the car.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
All I'm saying --
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Where's the woman?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
I'm lookin' scared?
What do you mean?
My shit is together.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Straight up?
Then good night.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Aw, what is this...
I ain't gonna shoot her.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Hardly the case, Senator.
"The Lark Report."
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Uh, ma'am.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
You'll think about my offer?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
The Navy Cross...
Probably hear back from CNN first.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
That bad?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
No shortage of suspects.
"In Washington..."
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
32 feet, six inches!
Say again, sir?
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Subject?
Where's Audrey?
What?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
He's not going to do it.
I'll take them all.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
What the hell are you doing?
You don't understand, I can get us information...
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
What sample?
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
Are you looking for this?
Do I know you?
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
God, what an ass.
Go ahead!
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Oh my god, It's real.
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
Those blue things ate everybody here?
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Hi Brandon.
Oh.  Okay.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
... Yes?
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
Shit! Go!
Systems register functional.
A hologram...
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
It's suicide.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Oh, they're so cute.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Hi everybody.
They're gone.
We're alive!
~e're alive!
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
never doubted you for a second.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
You're kidding. When for?
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Theramin.
An interstellar vox.
Weapons storage...
Then how did he find out about the device?
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
What's going on?
Excuse me?
Do your best, Tommy...
Anything.
Okay... On what?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Continue forward, sir?
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
What are we going to do?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
The British army, sir!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
And how rusty are these muskets?
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
That's right...
To win this war I need an army.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
You're out of your mind!
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
I reserved a Cadillac.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
I guess still in the locker.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
And that's for the airport.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Get something going there.
In just a second. Two...
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
Hello? You there?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
What?
How'd you get in here?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You have a card in here?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Something shouldn't be there.
I want you to.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
Part of it, yeah.
You mean, Leo?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
Ever shot anybody.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
What's it called?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
What do you get out of this?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
Here's your keys, Harry.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
I'm thinking of a movie.
What's that?
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Then you've read it?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Yeah?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
You okay?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I told you not to -
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
Hm?
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
What's wrong?
I don't have a dog.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Lufkin. His... agent.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Let's not be too hasty.
Where from?
Maureen.
Roger.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Guess I'll just keep working.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Did you?
Get up.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
How long, then?
Went aboard.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
You're late.
Could be a fishing boat.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Then why didn't they take it.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
What guy?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
The what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
What do we do with him?
They went crazy.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Greer to Murphy.
Let the buyer beware.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
I don't know.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
You're kidding, right?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Give up?
Are you still looking for a job?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
Who is this, Enid?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
...wow...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
That guy rules!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Yeah, right.
I just stopped in to say hi.
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Oh, hi...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Okay... I promise.
Hi Enid.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Hi.
Did you sign up yet?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
You can have that one.
I want to "make love" to him.
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
That was truly pathetic.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
We still have to go in there sometime.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
I totally, totally hate you.
Just now... I went with Seymour.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
You're just jealous.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Just some people from work...
Why? What did he say?
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Hello?
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I dunno...
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You still interested in that?
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Go die, asshole!
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Is this one any good?
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Well are --
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Wow, this is so cool...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Aren't you going to get that?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Oh, hi...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
What are you doing here?
Uh... sure... come in.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
Yeah, sure. Of course.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Talk to us about it...
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
What are you talking about?
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Let me see the sick.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Understand, I had help-
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
That's a terrible idea-
Go, now.  Such a gentleman.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
...one shot...
How lucky we are.
...misfire... it jammed...
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Good luck.
How many do you think they've killed?
Nonsense.
Oh yes, I think so.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
What are you working on, Egon?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Or we could do that.
Does she know anything about babies?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Is this the spot?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Sorry!
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
That's quite a story.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Well, good night, Louis.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
You've got to do something!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
These boys aren't playing around.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
Egon!
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
What's that?
This is what you do with your spare time?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
You finished here?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Aren't you glad we waited?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
You really don't act like a scientist.
Damn!
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Can't you tell me now?
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Great!  How's it going?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And may I see this storage facility?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Don't cross the beams.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
For what purpose?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Me, too.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Where is my family?
Caesar, ignore them.
Give away food?
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Yes, Caesar?
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
Servis made it through again?
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
I made the plume from a quail feather.
As soon as I can.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
What about their philosophy lessons?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Narcissus!
Take your hands off me animal!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Hello.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Do you always drive like this?
Why not?
But could you try?
Is anything wrong?
Okay.
What's the matter?
Why aren't you ready?
Yes.
-- really incredible --
Is it because I'm here?
Let me go.
Why?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Don't tell me --
The marble?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
The day after tomorrow?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Are you listening?
What's that?
One of those outside agitators.
Hello.
Benjamin?
Give me an hour.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
How are you, Benjamin?
You don't?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What do you think?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But they would! Don't you see?
What?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Hello, Benjamin.
Do you want to?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Will you bring me a hanger?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Wood or wire? They have both.
On your first time --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
How do you get out of the house?
Right.
Well how long has this been going on.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
What?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Well how did it happen?
Do you remember the make of the car?
I wish you'd tell me.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Do you understand that?
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Well, I'm not.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
What are you doing?
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
This is absurd.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Drive down the block.
How?
I say I've got it.
I drive around.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
I don't know. I want it to be --
Why?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Sir?
I know.
What?
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
No, I don't.
You miss the point.
Is anything wrong?
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
Time's getting short.
I want to speak --
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Oh!
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
That was lovely.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
And -- and --
Go away. Who are you --?
I want to be alone --
What can you see?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
That's a silly joke.
There.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I'll not denounce you.
So --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
Grusinskaya --
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Is that too much, Baron?
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Well -- last night was not so good.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
And the child isn't coming?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Any letters?
Oh!
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
No - absinthe.
Dance then?
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Please -- please!
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
Tired?
You...
No.
Cotton Company --
You're sweet.
Oh, no.
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water -- What a place!
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Sorry, Preysing.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
I can't dance tonight --
Let us cancel the engagement.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Certainly, sir.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Next week.
What you need is some relaxation.
Pretty as a picture.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Want a look?
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
Kaggs. Home office.
Sounds like a good Idea.
What? Me?
Well, uh... No.
Perk, remember?
So what's your story today?
What happened to your hand?
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
What?
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
For God's sake, Lilly!
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
The tap. What you do for a living.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Upstate.
Think about it. Okay?
You -- I don't know.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
You watch that mouth.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Yes, I know, I know.
What?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Carter.
Where?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
What the --
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
You really think Eddie killed her?
You look kind of cold.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Still wants to move out?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Hey, you alright?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
What's this?
Ooooh, busted.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Where are you going?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
We've never met.
Home, sweet home.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
You know what gets me?
At least we found the diamonds.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Can I have the Cadillac?
What'll you do for transportation?
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
I'm liable to find anything!
How short the skirts are.
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
Months?
You ever own a motorcycle?
Huh.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
All the more reason to go to Africa.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
Is Penelope in?
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Insurance!
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Hello.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Excellent!
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
A hundred dollars!
Can I get dressed first?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
What's that all about?
We all are.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Please--
Now that's what I call fun.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Which one?
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
And no one's there now?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Unless she has nerve.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
She's fine.  Please--
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
You've been bitten by bats?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
We have, have we?
What brought you back?
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're old--so old.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
Cut me open.  Find out.
Don Quixote.
The new hero is you.
Was I ever of use?
I'm going to shoot you now.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Thank you--for my life.
I'm only ten years old.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Kid--kid--
What's this?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Thank God!
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
I know.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Yes, he is.
What?
Yeah.
We don't have a maid any more.
My father!
I hate that thing.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
Yes?
I'm touched.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
What was it?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
We made the date three months ago.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
I just want to ask some questions.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
No, I don't.
What do you mean?
That's cool.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
I don't know no Tod.
Yeah.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you the star of this picture?
Are you Niki?
No.
Joanne?
Where is she?
No.
You don't drink?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
It's not quite the same thing.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Did you find out where she was?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
I've got a meeting...
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
I don't know.
Yeah. Probably.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Where'd you hear that name?
Is Marsha there?
How's your business, Jake?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
I don't know.
Who told you about this?
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
Fifty cents admission.
It's a short film.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Not exactly...
Com'on, tell me.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You are at the University, Candy?
Come again.
How long have you been driving?
Your tree.
Okay, lady. Out.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
No.
Check.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
And what do you do, my dear?
A block of ice.
Eh, no. Thank you.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Yearse!
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Sort of.
All right.
How about some ginger pie?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
No.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
It goes on and on.
You look as if you could.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Thank you.
I think he's following us.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Well, I really don't smoke.
With God?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
How about some candy floss?
Look at the stars.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Why?
Supper for two.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
No.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Harold?
None at all?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
What would you say?
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
That's right.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Stay where you are, Harold .
Yes.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Frank.
It's coming.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
I'm scared.
Nonsense, I...
I... remember.
Where am I?
Steve...
I need to touch it to "see"...
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
That's all for you, Sammy.
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
It's almost over!!
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Who's the squirt?
Got tired of me?
Well, you did break out --
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
That voice --
She's dead.
-- should go back. Now!
Whatcha looking at, John??
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
He -- loves you.
But it's not true, is it?
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
You fucking ass-holes.
What's happening?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Oh.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Many times.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Well?
No. God no.
What happened to you?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Well?
A long time.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
You would be. They tore me apart.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
You can't love him.
She'll tell them everything...
Maybe we should just leave --
This afternoon.
It's ONE of these.
Just a thought --
I thought half of it was your brother's?
All right.
Are you all right?
Huh?
What's wrong?
Not much fun, is it?
I suppose that's right.
No personal details?
What's going on?
I suppose not.
Why don't you do the same?
You're awake. Good girl.
I'll get the doctor.
What a pretty tune.
You wouldn't believe me.
Who's there?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Of course. Every day.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Kirsty.
What are you drinking, love?
Yeah.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
I'm afraid it's true.
Meaning what?
Oh no?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
We can take your car.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
None.  Christ!
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
That's what I said.
He's got one!
Don't do it, Rob!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Right.  Why?
Your desert island top-five.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Is that it?
Yeah.
'Morning, Dick.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
What is this.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Shit!
So you weren't interested in music at all?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Is it better?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Me?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Look, we can do other things.
Laura...
Mission accomplished.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Hi.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Just local, of course.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
So?
About what?
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Enough, Liz.
It's a great song.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
And after that?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
I think you have more.
How old is Richard?
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
No.
This is against the rules.
Byzantine?
Someone beat you.
You have an active imagination.
Why not?
Who is he?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You did kill those men.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Maybe it would do us both good.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Who are you?
I didn't kill the watchman.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it you want?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Forget it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Stop.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
I was driven out.
How can you know this?
He told me there could be only one.
I don't understand.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
Why does he want to kill me?
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
You're wrong.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
We must talk.
Do not turn your back on me.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
You've been here from the start.
What's the point?
We have some unfinished business.
I want you to come to me.
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
What were _you_ looking for?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
The resemblance is amazing.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Are you back?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I got my rhyming dictionary in --
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
The five hundred? Sure.
But --
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Hildy!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Just for the first year.
Anything the matter?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Hildy!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Hello, Hildy!
How long is what?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Double-crossing swine!
Hello -- hello...
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Ring that number, will you?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
In a way.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Hildy!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
What!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Walter!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
How much?
Let's see the money.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
After all I've done for you --
Where is he?
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
For who?
Pure politics!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
No -- don't out me off.
That's a lie!!
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Where's the old lady?
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
There goes another scrub lady.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Did you get that, Hildy?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Kings and sixes.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Earl, you must never do that again.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The City Sealer's office!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
Get out of here!
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
There she is!
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
What's he want?
Pauline's mum got killed.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
I did see them. I did.
What's that?
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
What about it?
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
What are you going to be then?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
What did he say?
I can't do it. What's the point?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
You're having me on, Molly.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Cone.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
What about the tree?
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
He walks, duh.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
You mean John Wayne?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
But suppose for a second you did.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
She's pretty cute.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Really fucking awesome.
It's a hitchhiker.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
What was that?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Should we stop?
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Fine. I'll go straight.
Forget it. I'll just go.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
What are you doing!
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Is that all... think real hard.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
How long is that gonna take?
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Huh?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Oh, yeah.
So what?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Thank you.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
What was that?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
What'd ya got there?
I'm gonna go ask him.
Just back up.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well hello, officer.
Grampa... watch the language.
Get in... now!
Turn up this road.
What about the body you found?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Wydell.
Hello, my little boy.
Say my name.
You decide. Today is your day.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Is everything fine?
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Oui.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
You were wonderful!
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You do?
What are you doing in there?
I'm sorry about my parents.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
What SPF, sweetie?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
You were gone a long time.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Oh boy!
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Extra dessert?
Ugnh.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Wait!
Mother?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Huh?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
And a fact is a fact.
To win.
You bastard.
We'll be there.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
How much do I owe you?
Make it twenty.
Only when I work.
Poker's not your game.
Character.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Sign up.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Sure.
When do I raise the bet?
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Who's he?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
In the gut, I mean.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Try me.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Okay, friend. You're on.
How long have you been waiting?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip?
Can I sit down?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Do you always ask so many questions?
Fifth of scotch?
Why did you do that?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
I'm hungry.
What did all this stuff cost you?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Give it back to me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Well, he owns things.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
What is it, Eddie?
What do you want to tell me?
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Very good shot.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
I came to play pool, Fats.
You name it.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
What choice did I have -- ?!
What do you want?
Humans.
That's who you are too, Emma.
Do you still want me to stay?
Emma...
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
We're going to be moving, son.
What's that, Dad?
Is the hill ours too?
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
We were having a little talk.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Do you know how to follow a map?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
What's his family background?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
You're being paranoid.
Just my luck, no ice.
I don't know how you put up with him.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Pops!
You still got the Olds?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Spunky?
Perfect, she's using it.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
How're we doing?
That's impossible...
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You scared the hell out of me.
Really? Ballet?
Oh. Sorry.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Stevie... I can't...
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Mr. President?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
May we go home now, please?
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
How's the head?
Henry, the pen --
The Word of God...
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
You could be more right than you know.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
It must be one of these...
What's that?
Don't wander off.
You came back for the book? Why?
It's important!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
But what are you doing here?
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
You did!!
What am I looking for?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
And the chair.
What?
Dad!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
What does that mean?
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Ready?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I don't need camels.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
This is your last chance.
Who are you?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
That's far enough!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
What'd he say?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
A what...?
Can you move your arm?
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Couldn't keep away, huh?
He's afraid of something.
Any more complaints?
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
What?!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
My name is AL.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Do me a favor, Al.
My place, can't you see?
Who are you?
Yeah...Who?
Are you threatening me?
What are you doing?
You're not crazy.
Of course you do!
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
I'll talk to them.
What'd he look like?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I don't know...To get Al.
I did. I brought you back here.
Now what.
Just walk down the hall?
A lab and equipment.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Black suits and helmets.
You need ID in there?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
Oh yeah, to what?
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Holy shit!
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
.
Where are you going?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Much too blue.
Not that tie with that coat.
Which one is she?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
I feel like an idiot.
Voice stress analyzer.
You're doing great with her.
What is it?
You shut down your sensors.
Bingo.
Osaka.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What are you doing?
It's him.
Holy...
Dieter!
Do something.
I have been... I think you're right.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What are you doing?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
What is your name?
I didn't do anything.
Nice?
What kind of a deal?
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
We'll have to let them go.
Sir?
Yes?
I don't want to intrude.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Your memory.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Ahhh...nothing.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
Yes...What is it?
Then who did?
Oh...and who is it!?
Is someone else here?
You again.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Your friends, did they ask about me?
You work for Ryuji?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
Who was?
And Dieter.
What?
How?
I know the territory.
Why not?
Are you alright?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
It wasn't me. It was him.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Right there.
This the only spare?
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Where?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
P.J.'s.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What does that do?
Sure.
Do you want more rice?
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
You're taking "no" for an answer?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
A gun? Yes.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Jeffrey Wigand...
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
We're there.
Yeah.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Oh, man.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Lowell.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Who's that?
How much would I get paid?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Next to your father?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Jeff...
Good. But Jeff...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
No? No, what?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
You manipulated me into this...!
You try and have a good time.
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What do you mean there is no family?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
"I would bet on it."
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Baby. You are so HOT!
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
So she's uh, flourishing?
What a touching story.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Excuse me?
That's his lawyer.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
How nice.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
Getting married.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Screw you, asswipe!
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Friends?
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want to be your -- your wife.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Honey, I could sit...
I have a surprise for you.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Hello?
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Income tax evasion?
Hello, Rex.
Forgery and Fraud?
Miles Massey.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
But you're going through with it?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Mr. Massey --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
What?!
My client has ruled that out.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Mr. Rexroth.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She owes me a meal.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hi, Sweetie.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
How is she?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Who said anything about a reward!
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Fine man to fall in love with.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Oh, nono.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why; naturally, I
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Driver!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
What happened?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Do you mind putting out the light?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Thanks, professor.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
I better go over and see her.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Not a one.
Peter
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Really?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What're you going to do?
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
What happened?
What about money?
That's swell!
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
But can't you wait until morning
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
I said, the old man's screwy!
The dame's too smart for him.
Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Huh?
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
A trumpet?
Send it collect.
Thenyou'll have to git !
Well, you're two up on me now.
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Where do you live?
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Did he pay you for this?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
Can you get some sworn statements?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
It leads farther than that.
What do you mean?
Why?  What's wrong?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I want the truth.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Aren't you being a little hard?
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Did they live?
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Can we find her?
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
Time?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Are they?  Why would they?
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
And he never hit you before?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Why were you with him?
And you didn't tell the Police?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
What's going on?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
What's this?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I'd love one, but not there.
Is it dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You're not tired of it?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
What'dya think?
Somebody loan it to you?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
How do you get it out?
How do you feel about getting old?
Really?
How'd you feel about it?
I walked right past you.
Does it happen to all men?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
You don't actually do it that way?
I called you last night.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
Did you do it that night?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Ray wants him.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
That's Ordell's.
Madrid or Barcelona?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
What if I plead guilty?
We'll just be a minute.
Oh, so now you know him?
You ever see him sell guns?
Then how do you know he sells guns?
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
She didn't say.
Yes. All those things are true.
What did you do after that?
Sure.
How long you been with Ordell?
What were you two fighting about?
Are you getting that black suit?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
The Cockatoo Inn.
You told em? You told em it's me?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
No, I give it to someone else first.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
What does she think she's gettin?
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Where at?
Four years?
What for?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
He went to meet that stewardess.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Lemme have the bag.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Whatcha watchin'?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
How much is there?
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
It's Louis.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
So what, you left her there.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Then what?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Jesus Christ.
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
I'm going out for a few hours.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
House or apartment?
Comfortable?
It still sounds high.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
How'd you find me?
How the fuck did he find me?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She was afraid.
Who is it?
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
He ain't here right now.
Get me out of here.
Remember?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
You know, you got a strange line here.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Hey, wait!
There was a bang.
Don't go.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
He say what they looked like?
You think they're connected?
I saw Sarah the other day.
A bit.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
What are you doing?
Are you in the service?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
Jake, is that you?
Gee, thanks a lot.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
I must have been out of my head.
Is that the one who died?
Oh, come on. It's early.
Why? What for?
What does it say?
How high is that?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't gimme that.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Remember that.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Please.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
Goddamn you!
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
I'll page him.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Still married, Jake?
I just need to talk.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
The army?
A car accident.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
You see that?
We're not supposed to do that.
We'd need charges.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Jesus what the hell is that?
What the hell are you doing?
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
That's why I'm here.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Rizzo, you okay?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
You okay?!
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
That's really funny.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
I'll help you in.
Now that's just gross.
You must shut down the engines.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
This is what it means right here.
I'm gonna spew.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
What are you doing?
No.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Do I have to?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
More soldiers?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
My cars. And a comic book.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Don't forget these.
Love ya.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Only 24 hours!
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Who's that young man?
She's right.
Got a pen on you?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
He ate a car?
What is all this stuff?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Where'd you get all this?
What happened?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Wait a minute! I need you.
Quint...?
What day is this?
You here for the summer?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Over there!
I'll drink to your leg.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
What can that gun of yours do?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
You know how I feel about her.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
What's up?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Wait, let me take that.
Mine too.
Can we make out now?
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What? I'm not made of stone.
What is your job title, exactly?
Nails? Really?
Wow, dream big!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
No.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Yeah.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Why aren't you at work?
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Cool.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Who is the kid?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Hi Dad.
Yeah, she does.
Dad, no!
I sort of already have.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
The Penny Saver sucks.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Hly shht!
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
You don't say.
What do you make with that?
What?
What would be a good time for you?
Have you found a place to stay?
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
What?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Who said he's my good buddy?
Carrie... stop it.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Any word from that gallery?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
You're clean.
What do you think?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
You know what else?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
You down with the boost?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
That.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Shut up.
So really, it's good luck.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
Nah.
Casper! Was up kid?
You goin'?
You sure?
Sup. Sup.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Do you like kissing me?
Uh huh.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
What do I want to do?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Dance!
How old are you?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Are you in trouble with the law?
You didn't?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Do you know where he went?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
Where does everyone sleep?
Slow.
I can't man.
Morpheus.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You're a lying bastard!
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
What do you think?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
No shit!
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
You still having a problem with this?
How is she?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
A few people.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
To get your attention.
And -- what path is that?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Hello.
Please... wait.
I know where you are.
What's this?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
What scars?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Come here.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
I know he really likes you.
Congratulations, dad.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
How long has she been dead?
Any sign of rape?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Well?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
I'm busy right now.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
He's right, Kathy.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Did you see his face?
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
You're always in the middle of a match.
Feel like practicing?
Are you one of the players?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
We need your help.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
You have to win every point, don't you?
No.
Why?
It was.
What?
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
Fine.
I tried again and got through.
Peter, you have to admit--
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Hi.
Peter...
It's over now.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Me too.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Lyssa ...
Where is the Fortress?
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Yes.
Lyssa ...
You will go alone.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
The new Queen lives.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Yes.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
The spiral begins in the west.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
How did you know?
I road them often in my youth.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
I'm not hungry.
You've eaten nothing.
Go. I command you.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Where are you going?
Sugarballs?
I'm hungry.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
We meant only to please you.
Put me down, you lout!
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Food for crows.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
What news from our friends?
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
It is the time.
Can you see?
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
Yes.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
But you would not stay with me.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
It will not help.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
130... 140...
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
...You don't believe me, don't you?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Is he still alive?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I don't accept that.
Nothing's going to happen.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
It's a special day isn't it?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I want children.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Your father?
Why there?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
What did they ask?
Why?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
Are you firing me?
Phileas Fogg?
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Tom Joad?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Good morning.
What's your shoe size?
What do you want?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Orange soda?
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
I sometimes fade out.
If I was I'm sorry.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
You OK?
Thank you. What time is it?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Sera...
Sera... what you don't understand is...
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
I don't understand any of that.
I like it here with you.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Where have you been?
Don't hit me.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
But it's a top three school --
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Did you get it?
You're not going up there.
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
You ready?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
How'd it go at the trial?
You almost had me fooled.
I'm a bitch.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Too demure?
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
She's not!
The what?
I can't.
Whoa -- Why?
Oh, my God!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Neither.
I did?
Amazing how?
I completely agree.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
You go where?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
I didn't mean --
You look -- nice.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Let's all go! Road trip!
Why?!
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
More fun win battle?
My generosity is not so large as that.
You... you're a beast!
And you... are you not also afraid?
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
No more... please...
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
You're a beast!
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
What do I do?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
Shhhh!
What is it?
Damn them!
Aye!  That too.
Track the demon to his lair.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Wait, Jack.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Give in to despair and all is lost.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Water doesn't burn...
What magic have we on our side?
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Will you explain what's going on?
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
I was with the Princess.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
How're these?
Dolt!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
You promised!
But you did... you did!
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Jack!
What happened?
My lady mocks me.
I thought you were dead... I --
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Sigurd's sword...
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
I don't believe you.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
How so?
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Please...
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
Praise be to God.
Where?
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Sorry, Jack.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
How came you by this blade?
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Is he a friend, then?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
He's not there.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
He hasn't called?
I put him to work.
I'm going to bed.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
What's today?
It's not what I was expecting.
Hey.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
He's a freak.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so uptight?
What's the point of this?
Josh said...
I was wondering.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
This is such a street of whiners.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Oh, yes.
I hate to ask about a window.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Maybe...?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Sam?
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Probably in the bible.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
No one would blame me if I left!
I don't beg.
I can promise you complete privacy.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Where are you going?
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
You can't make me do a thing.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I know the feeling.
What are you now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
You look better than ever.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
And you told Mom today?
What would you do?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
What?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Kurt's been feeding him.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
One of you would end up dead.
I used to live here.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I'm married.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I could die.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Hey.
The door was open.
You're sure about this?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Queer.
I brought a few of my own.
Adam, that's not true!
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
A night in the hole?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
She's alright, isn't she?
I got it... boss.
Engagement ring!
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
What are they gonna do to us?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
That's some long green.
What?
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
That's right, a loan officer.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
What are you talking about?
What ain't there?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
So?
No, man. I want you to have it.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
You get ketchup?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
I can't do it.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
How you doin'?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
He's from New York City. That one, too.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Mama?
What are you doing here, mama?
I can't take that, mama.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Now will you get in the flask?
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
And give you a good buzz.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
I'll call her later.
Valerie's crying!
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Did you just talk?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Makin' friends already.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
This is bad, Nicky.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Bus?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
Boogerland!
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
What's with that guy?
This don't look good.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
You gotta kill yourself.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
The South.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
What were you thinking coming here?
No.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
We're going to Jersey?
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Don't do it.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Do me.
Off limits.
Hey...
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
How do you want us?
How did they get in here?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Had enough?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
You missed something special.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Of course.
What's going on, Logan?!
Why did you do that??!!
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Well then...?
Sad? What made you sad?
You felt sad. What's your name?
Later.
I'm not armed.  Well?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I'd rather be with you.
Uh-uh.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
I hate outside! I hate it!
We can't. We're going back.
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
Beloved husband...
How long have you been living here?
Are there any other humans?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Well? How do you like it?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
What's that, Ed?
Okay...
Sure.
Pete?
You like it?
So, should I call Andy?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You got him.
You killed him.
Where's the bathroom?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Dick Laurent?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
What night is that?
Please tell me.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Where's Pete?
Did you ask him who he is?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
What is this, Rogoff?
He's not Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
That's it.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Something wrong?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
What's that?
Same one you were reading the other night?
From the club. You didn't answer.
So?
We will.
What was that?!!!
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
The heart, I guess.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Give that a try.
Okay.
What's goin' on?
I missed you.
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
No... I told you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Sheila?!
I don't know.
Where'd you come from?
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
All of it?
Two years!?
I see.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Is it?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Charming chap.
Well, that's that, I guess.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
You mean you don't want to go?
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Please let me help you.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Are you taking me?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Porters?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
George, what do you think you're doing?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
What about the others?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Good.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Was this your idea?
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
I'm thirty.
I'm so glad.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Ouch!
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
The hell happened?
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
You think we're nuts.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
It'll make sense later?
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
What's going on, Kay?
The radio show?
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
How does that help me?
It's marble.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
What do we do?
What are you doing?
Yeah ... ?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Er. well, nowhere special.
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Wally!
What?
He's here.
I can't.  I have to know.
Oh, God...
The other two will die without me.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
You don't remember me, do you?
I put you away --
You made those tapes...
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Somewhere near the capital?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Okay... now let me time you.
It's a little late for that.
Oh, Sean --
Who are you?
But you have to.  They said you would.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Heal who?
You're talking about the precogs...
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
What?
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Oh, God, what did you do?
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Congratulations, sir.
How did you get this?
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
What?
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
Raincheck?
This your work?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
They've never been separated before.
Yeah.
You sure? I just made it.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Thank you very much, sir.
What, sir?
It's on West Broadway.
I don't get it. What do you do?
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
Oh no. What is it this time.
What the fuck was that about?
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
Ricky's not wearing one.
What's wrong, baby?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Oh my god. What happened?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
You talk to Max today?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Whu --
I -- I -- I... Don't...
What's up? Jess ready?
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
So, when's the drop.
How bad is it?
What's that?
You like the ponies?
You bet the ponies?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
A bad heart.
'Trustafarians?'
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I gotta pick up the baby.
What? Did she say something?
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
Who you calling?
How much is it?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
What exactly did they say?
They didn't say an address?
This is bullshit, man.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
So is this the drop?
He woulda told us right?
Yeah.
You happy?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
What the fuck was that about?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
All the more reason.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Calm down.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
So what do we do?
Dude, we were practically made...
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Kinda. Yeah.
Where's the surprise?
What's up, man.
How much is what?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
It means you got a gun?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm half Irish.
Coke?
Come, now. You just got here.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Yeah.
So whenever we want...
A lot of Persians?
Yeah.
Keys.
We're square.
No. I'll take a strega.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
The Red Dragon.
So, we're talking money laundering...
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
I am.
Dip?
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Why?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Man live by his rep.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
What you say?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
What can I do for you?
I'll have it tomorrow.
Is the program ready?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
I see your point.
Could we sit down someplace?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
It will be rough.
We need you too!
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Dear heart, where are you?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
Brother Earl.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
You the man.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
That's a fine chick.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
You want to be the head man?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
What am I doing here?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Why?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[How much do you want?]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Were you provided with a gun?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
We're taking a different way home.
And don't start crying.
What are you doing?
No.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
You feel sorry for the husband?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
You're late.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Then be trained.
Be a swimmer.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
It makes it all seem so serious.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Where are you?
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
I like him, Mom.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
Bye, Mom.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
I think it's nice he's American.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
You helped him get this job.
Hey, Herbie...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
It's early.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
I don't think I remember him.
Who?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Who?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Marty.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
Yeah.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
You say something?
What?
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
So I'll die without a son.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
He coming home right now.
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Where?
Y'all mind the store.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
You  must  open  me  up  again?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Make it yourself, or is it real?
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
Never mind. Forget it.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We think the same way.
Wait a second...
I was just asking...
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
And there it is.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
Look.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
He only lasted one season.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
What's the matter?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
How did you get called that?
Very happily married.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
You really say the cutest things.
He's coming to.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
No, never in the slightest.
In the direction you want to go.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
I have not understood what you means.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
How is he?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Huh?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Did you write this?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
That's good.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
The Websters!
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
That's our man. He's made to order.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Duets? But can we trust him?
Had any schooling?
Hello! . . . Yeh?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Hey, Boss.
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
St-rike!
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
A what?
Sure, you are.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Four bits.
Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Sure.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
That's got nothing to do with it!
Oh!
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Is there a crowd in the street?
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Where's the stereo?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
I won't get away with it.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Where's the car?
Hi, Roper.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
Open your shirt.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
How do you feel after a shooting.
Recruited you from where?
How did you like Toronto?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
You know the ten commandments?
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
The 6 horse is still last.
They need to run first and second?
We won!
And what about the ones you don't save?
That's a chance I gotta take.
McCall, you all right?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
I worship you.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Maybe you should be.
It's already started.
What do you think?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Korda escaped.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Scottie, Scottie...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Roper.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Roper...
This is Halden.
There are two million people in there with you.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
Why --
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Who are you?!
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
You sure he's going to come?
What's her name?
He had keys.
You're jumping to conclusions.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
There was no need to kill her.
Insurance?
What brings you inside?
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
But I don't know anything about programming.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
I wasn't with you.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Program name?
Connect to public access.
We've got him locked!
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
I heard that!
Release the power WITH the power.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
I see... a fox
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
PTERODACTYL!
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
NEW POWER COINS!!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
It's... an eagle?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Hey, boss!
I'm outta here.
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
That was a CHEAP shot!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
I am the mighty ape!
NINJA APE ZORD!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Life knocked me back.
And now you have everything.
What do you mean?
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
You ain't even a man yet.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Inside, they were talking of you.
What's the matter?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Something came up.
You got something to hide?
Have you thought about this?
I booked passage to London.
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
We'll figure out something.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Come off it, Bugs.
You boys carryin' pieces?
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
He's an animal!
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
The terms will be mine.
Forget it. That's past.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Forget it.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Best we got.
Who did this?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
At the moment, yes.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Stu...LOOK!
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
You know, you never tell me anything.
What's wrong?
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
What happened?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Huh?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Did you like the first act?
Oh--yeah--
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Drunks are funny--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
The war's on!
That infernal phone!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away.
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
*You won't?*
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
I did. What about it?
A dirty frame!
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Ah, now, that's better.
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Fine--
*No*!
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
A *day*!
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
I did--and--and I got right up.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
Yes, yes--
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Abigail.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
What you *have* to do is fight!
Yay!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
That's--that's splendid.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Ax?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
I know that.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
You want to see me, Senator?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
That's right.
No?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
That's him. Let him in.
What do you think?
Jim!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
How nice.
Will the Senator yield?
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
That's going to be fun.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Most every day.
He sure is pixilated.
Are you married?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
No. Are you?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
But they did take place?
And you saw them happen?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
Tell me more about yourself.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Here's a nice place.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Yeah, I know.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Ready?
In a day or so, I think.
Well, here we are again.
Good night.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
Is that the best you've got?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
I wish you luck, sir.
Thank heaven.
It's a lie!
Newspaperman?
Hang up.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
You're going to New York with us.
No?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
That's funny. Why is that?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I'm Chairman?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Look, he's temperamental.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
South Dakota - north?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You came home last night - without them.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Hey, did you hear that?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
You can go out there if you like...
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
What an asshole!
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
I see.
Why? I'm paying for this.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
No?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
What?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
You do?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
What it might take is... doing time.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Got a license?  But no car?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Can you help Mom?
Hiya, Doc.
How are you?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
I think you know what I mean.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
What can you tell me about this?
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Please... forgive me.
Sore throat?
It's all right.
Which thing?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Sofie...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
We're only talking about six weeks.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Amazing.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Who else knows?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
You know where he's taking her?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
C'mon, friend.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
And what is he in prison for?
And what did he say?
Two hundred pounds.
You lie.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Yes.
For what?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
It's everybody's problem!
That's what I am to you? A contract?
You...! YOU...!
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
What?
We gotta get her back.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
We could really use some coffee --
Atta, girl!
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Mon Captain, it's for you.
Eat your mustard.
How's your dad?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Superheroes.
And the light goes out...
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who's the artist?
I'd better go.
I admire you.
What's your real name?
At the Frankenstein Center.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
What are you talking about?
I'm liking this.
Have you ever seen him?
There's a big difference.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
Why not?
The who?
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Sounds good.
Maybe there was traffic.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Yes, Obie-wan.
Wow.
Jeffrey!
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
This is bad.
Or Batman --
Don't crunch the leaves.
And there's the Sphinx.
That was too close.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
Ah -- you approve?
What do you mean?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
And who is defending Paris?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
I don't know, sire.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Hello there, Picart.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
No -- not as a rule.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
When is she supposed to return?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
Were you in love with him?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were you in love with any of them?
Promise me you will never leave me.
Promise.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
But you will not... be safe...
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
That's all I can say.
Yes.
What?
You couldn't face telling me what?
What was there to tell?
How do you know?
Do you like music?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Is he alone?
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
It's cool, but where's the water?
I know you smoke weed, right?
No.  Thought he was with you.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
Nobody!
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
What?
Who is that?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
I ain't trying to get in it.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You see that?
I hope to God that dog is happy.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Most definitely.
Huh?
I did.  Is that door locked?
You alright?
Here I come!
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
You coming in?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
You see that?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
I do.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
What you say?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
William.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
My back.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I appreciate that.
You were very nervous.
You shot her?
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
What about the gun?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
You killed him.
I killed you.
How am I supposed to get away?
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
Is that something precious?
But...
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Lynn!
I have to do something.
I said I have to do something.
You got anything smaller?
Please. Something is going to happen...
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Irene is going to help.
What am I supposed to say to her?
What are you going to do!?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
You have, huh?
I'm not a baby.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
That one.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Yeah.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
You understand?
Leavin', boy?
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
He lied!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Hing, hang, hung.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
John...
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I'm hungry, John.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Now: Where?
Nothin'.
Now it's your turn.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
O no! Your turn!
John's bad.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Mister Powell?
How's that?
What do you figure to do?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Get up, Willa.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
I been bad!
You'll whip me!
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
It's just a stupid cat.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Okay?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Did you sleep?
Get into bed.
You okay?
You okay?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Give me the key, mother.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Do you think I did it?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Nice to have a fire.
What you dream?
You feel better now, right?
When did you have a nightmare?
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
An evening gown.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
That's her.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
That must be the one!
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Guest?
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
What time have you, Gaston?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne...
If you want to see us you must come later.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
A week?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
Allow me, Comrade.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Don't hold that against me... please!
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Yes!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
What for... why?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Can I help you?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Why do you need my finger?
And where are we?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Yes, it is.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
And what do you do for mankind?
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You repeat yourself.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
I wish they had never met.
You remember this room?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Comrades! Comrades!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Radio! What is radio?
No music.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Hello, Leon!
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
What did he say?
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
She's gone, Leon.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
That's all right... I grow on people.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Good morning, Comrade.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
How much do you need?
I agree it's ridiculous but --
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
It's a code or something.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
McCord? ...
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again.
This is not a joke, John!
The country's loving it.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
This is June twentieth?
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
About a dozen.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
More light, chief?
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
No.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
You'll win the nomination.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Who do you think is behind it?
Kissinger?
Why, you got a customer?
Who we working for?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
Yes.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
How about Kissinger along with him?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Hi.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
So I'm supposed to be ...
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
We lost ...
It makes us human ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Anything.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
And what am I doing?
Hiding what?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
How'd you know I was here.
How you been, Ellis?
Didn't know there was any.
How fresh is this coffee?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Not word one.
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Carla Jean...
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
That's the boy.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
Probably must be.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir. It was punched out.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
...Be careful.
Don't get hurt.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
What do you think.
I mean, would you care to join me.
...How'd you sleep?
I got it Mama.
Did you buy that gun?
Odessa.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Promise?
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
I know where the money is.
Where does he work?
Hello?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
Airport.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Is somethin' wrong?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Yes I do.
Call it.
Yes.
How's that?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Tent poles.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
One room, one night.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
You tell me the option.
Could I get another room.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
What did you do?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I don't mean braze.
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Could I have that in American?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Bad idea...
Junior year!
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
You must be joking.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Did you watch it yet?
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
So, call me when you --
What're you doing here, Roy?
Yes.
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Where you headed, Betty?
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
I left my husband two days ago.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
No. Loma Vista.
You're hurting him!!
I got this apartment with a guy.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Looking for someone?
Rosa...
You should have a little faith in people.
...this is your sweater, right?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Really. And where was that, old man?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
That's right.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
What?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
...and how long did she work here?
What'd you get her?
Jesus Christ!
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
...Pete?
Huh?!
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Pete have a brother?
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Where's your ring, honey?
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
An' all my meals for free...
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
It was a moment a weakness!
...Yeah?
Daddy!
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Okay, okay. You win.
Great ass.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
When did this happen?
What's your name, boy?
I want to fly jets, sir!
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
How late?
What other issue is there, Sid?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
How did it go with you guys?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Do you go to school?
I vote for the motel.
There's always a choice.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
That was great.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
Jets.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
What? You've gotta be kidding!
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
Sid, what happened?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What if she called the cops?
Me.  I am.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Are you okay?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
Bullshit.
They're not supposed to be here!
Who is this guy?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Open it.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
What do you want?
Can we come in?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
That door is a safely hazard.
Push that button for me, will you?
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Ever read any Poe?
Damn it!
"What we want is in that room."
Fuck.
What, what, what is it?!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
He'll do something.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Those ain't cops.
Lemme see that rifle son...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Like?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Inspector Brimmer
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Now hold on Rodgers...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
I don't think that will be any problem...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
We're working on that...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
You were. infantry right?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
What's the pig's name?
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Huh?
My Mom's at that.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
Excuse me?
Goodbye, Charlotte.
We did.
Shall we proceed?
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
That is a separate issue.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
If I fail, you fail.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
What now, sir?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Did your father teach you humility?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
Is it?
These four wagons must be his.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
You learned her lessons better than I.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Don't go in there.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
You don't hate him.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Your son, what did you name him?
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Thank you.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
That bad?
Not yet, Thomas.
Seventeen.
Father?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
No-I guess not.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Huh?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
But don't you dare say that.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Do you swear?
I can hardly read these.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
What say, Louis?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Can I have another one?
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Gage's gone!
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
That's enough of that kind of talk!
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
Well, honey...you know that...
You stole my boat.
What's in your head, boy?
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
No, I really think I do.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
There's ... another exit?
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Do you believe him?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
You have a name, missy?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
What?
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I'm glad we got here in time.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
Miss Swann.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
How did you get off the island?
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Dead serious.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
Where does it make berth?
Agreed.
Come aboard.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
What's that?
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
You've seen it?
I think he's telling the truth.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
How long do you leave him in there?
Wheelchair accessible.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
I know what you're doing.
Oh no?  Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Icarus?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Yeah?  So what?
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
What are you going to do?
Is that what Argon told you?
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Sir, please try to hold still.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Yeah.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
Why do we need it?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
Do you have something to bring me down?
I could go with you.
That's going to fit me?
Who is he?
What in the...?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I could have you fired right now.
Icky!
That's considerate of you.
Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
Where did you get those letters?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Do you like them?
I know that.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm not going!
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
What is this person doing here?
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Yale '21, I believe.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Impossible. Put it on again.
What do you want?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Come on, get going, get going!
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Well, when are you quitting?
No?
You what?
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
My error.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
There you are!
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Okay.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
No.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Traps shut!
I suppose you know why I came?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Yes.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Stop calling me Mother!
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
And you struck him right here in our house?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Yes sir.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Have you got any make up?
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
It's alright. Let me see.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Sure is pretty.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Want some bridge mix?
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Are you alright?  What is it?
What happened?
Did you do this?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Noooooo!
You know him?
Can we do any better?
I could like kill a guy with these things.
So what's the point?
What did you do to him?
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
Sure.
Are you sure?
You got the admissions letter.
Hi.
So what's it like?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
You're gonna forget about me.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Don't get upset.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Excuse me?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I had nothing to do with that.
Look ...
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
Do you have the lettuce?
Oh hi!
Really?
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
It's beautiful.
TV repair.
Dream come true, hunh?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
What's the listing?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Why?
Yeah I can't.
Why's it here?
Tell me why.
No.
Sure.
No.
It doesn't matter.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Are you telling me no?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Do you know them.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Hello?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Why?
I cut myself.
On my knife.
I didn't do that.
Your hand is bleeding.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
What do you mean?
It's ok, take your time.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
Can we agree that that is that?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How many sisters do you have?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
What is this?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
What happened?
Yes.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
I won't.
Ok.
I know.
Ok.
I don't really remember that.
Hello?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
I must grant him his last rites.
And --?
I have a proposition.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
What on earth would that require?
Go to hell!
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
It was not inspired by circumstance.
He'll do no such thing.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Yes?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
Did I frighten you?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
It's a long story, this one.
What have they done to you now?
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
"...your wife."
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
-- words alone are insufficient.
Good God, Marquise --
This is neither the time nor the place --
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
That poor woman.
God, these parties are the worst
I did my best but, well, you know me
Louis
There. That's right.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
It's not really--
Then you explain it to me?!
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
You are repellant when you drink.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Why did we not know about this sooner?
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
I wanna see the picture today
What are movies about, Orson?
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
But with compassion and insight--
Manolete?!
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Yes.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
So, who is he? We have to know him.
What?
Jesus Christ --
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
You gonna watch?
Mank!
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
It came.
To do what?
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
It was the best, kid
Orson, you wanna take five?
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Hey champ!
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Sure. What is it?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Who's that?
Yeah --
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Say what you're gonna say.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Nah, she would never...
Whatcha doin'?
Except fall down like a normal person.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Screw you, Jack.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
You're not interested in him?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
I went out.
I called. You weren't there.
Jake --
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Why don't you just call him up?
Sure, what else is new?
The kids are sleeping.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Hey, leave the kids alone.
I said, let's go.
This is Doyle's house.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Name me a better photographer.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Like disposing of their wives?
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
His wife took a trip.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
-- until yesterday morning.
Feel a little foolish?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
This is Wednesday.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I'll send you some comic books.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Hello.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Jeff --
Hello.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I can't. The police have it by now.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Isn't he a salesman?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Mrs. Thorwald?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
No.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Hello.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
What is it you're looking for?
Maybe she died.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
The same.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
What's happening?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
You satisfied or you want more?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
What's he going to pull--
You see any cops?
You can't protect me.
You thought I was Mom?
You awake?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
What would you do, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Go ahead.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Is he there?
Frank!
John Crawford?
You remember me?
You shouldn't monkey with him.
You scared?
No.  It's perpetual motion.
I'm here.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I came here before.
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
Why?
Can I keep it?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Why?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
He called me chicken.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
If he could--
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Hi.  I saw you before.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Where's Dawson High School?
It doesn't matter to them.
Why did you do that?
Oh, Jim!
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I never felt so clean before.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
After he tried to shoot you?
Plato, where's your father now?
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
How did you know that?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Good evening.
I was talking to Dad.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
A man of some travels.
He wants... your "sister"...
-- till he fucked his parole --
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No --
No, c'mon --
I told you, Nick. Remember?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
You need a COAT!
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
...the truck driver...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
You motherfucker.
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Nick died for me....
No!
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
They've never done a robbery?
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
I saved your life.
But I never said Rudy.
You're not Nick Mason...
Where's she work?
What'd they call her in college?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What?
I did.
They won't recognize me.
Do I get a country-western name?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
Start singing.
No.
Ash?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
That motherfucker --
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How long ago was your makeover?
You want that for here or to go?
Hell you haven't.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Hot chocolate.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Rudy, don't move --
Jesus, Rudy --
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Ash... Ashley...
NO!!!
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That was my king!
Switch seats with me.
That I should've picked you up?
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Seymour Scagnetti.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
What?
I can do that.
Tell me more about Cabot.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
I'm sorry.
Who's your parole officer?
How is he?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Your name's Freddy something.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What's this guy's problem?
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
For what, the cops?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Nope.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
So, is he dead or what?
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Why!
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
This must have been in the family a long time.
You can't leave us here.
Our kind of women?
What's the matter with her?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Where do you keep the can opener?
There's a nice boy.
So that was why she tried to run away.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
We can't stay here!
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Thanks for taking over.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
I can't --
That's right.
What was he in jail for?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
What did you come back for?
Is that the only reason you came back?
You'll live.
I can't take her with me.
That something I shouldn't see?
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got company. Female company.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Good night, Miss Wells.
Gee, I can't.
How about California?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Goodnight.
Are you okay?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Me, too. 101?
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Help!
Oh my God! We're dead!
It's coming!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Hello Brenda.
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Maybe we can study together or something.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Hi Buddy.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Buddy...
Where the hell are we?
Let's get outta here.
Yes...
Are you okay?
How about these buns?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Where's Shorty?
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
This can't be happening?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Are you?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
I got it!
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Here you go, Professor.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
My God! Is she dead?
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
You never could feel your legs.
You're not wearing a belt.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
No thanks.
Father, I think you should rest.
"Ray!"
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
What a bitch!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
No comment!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
No woman would!
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I love that you're my wife.
You bring me such peace...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
You bitch!
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
State your name, please.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
Beverly, are you alright?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
You scared?
Let's get out of here.
When I wanted to.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
How much does she want?
I haven't got that much in cash.
Why, Mary --
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Redi's all right.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
And that was all?
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
The people at the restaurant?
What have you done about Irving August?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
And you knew he'd be here.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And the other was Judd?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
What was she to you?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I was a great dancer...
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
Is it about Jacqueline?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'm afraid not.
I'll be out in a minute.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
But he also wrote --
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Graham is an unusual name.
Oh, uh-huh.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, uh-huh.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Would you mind?
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
You're what?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Hi!
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
No.
This is just... so...
You know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
That's a good question.
Did you have sex before you were married?
About who?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Her name was Elizabeth.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
And you feel the same way with John?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I can't.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
You're not answering me.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Yes. I just got busy.
Loud.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Why?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
Bastard...
You son of a bitch!!
No, I didn't.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
God, no.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
What are you talking about?
Lose something?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Fine.
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Apparently.
Yes, I did.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Thank you.
Do you have my work number?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
The extrovert.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
And you ask questions, right?
How long will it take?
Your first sexual experience.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Prettier than Ann?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Cynthia, I don't know.
John?
Not today. I've got other plans.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Hung up.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Student?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
What tapes?
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Medical clinic?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Kiss, kiss?
Anything wrong?
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
You say something?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Yes? Who is there?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't seem worried about them.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
BREAKING OUT
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
When do I get to see Brad?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
How did you come by this scenario?
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Mental instability?
I'd forgotten.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
You shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
I NEED SOME
Brad!
Our field.
This could be worse than the old series.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Isn't she lovely?
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Miles.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
My condolences.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
What do you think?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
You got it.
Is it chicken?
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
I can explain.
Hiya.
Anything I'd know?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
You still seeing that shrink?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
How would you rate this one?
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
She what?  When?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
We're on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Oh, boy.
Right now.
What?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Nice shot.
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
What is it?
We're on.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Love you, man.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Well...
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Maya.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Oops. Sorry.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Stephanie! Stop!
It was a surprise, Mom.
What's the matter?
What are you thinking about?
No.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Daddy.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
That roof is over ten feet high.
How can you say that?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He was only a year and half old.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
They'll read our minds!
Did someone save me?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I don't think so.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
All I did was kiss a girl.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Forget it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
I almost didn't.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Offend anybody lately?
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
You might make a farmer yet.
You own this land.
What about the law?
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Where's your brother?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Rae, all we got is each other.
Why him?
He must be pretty good.
What about his brother?
You've got a legitimate job.
I took out thirteen dollars.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
I thought we talked about that.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
You work here?
And I know what I'm talking about.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
You really are a gambler.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I've got a place I can hide her.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
The picture's dead.
Where is she?
Why isn't she with you?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
-- You can't go in there!
Really?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
You look so, so...
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
You can't.
Is she here?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
-- We call them "vactors".
-- Flesh is weak.
"Straw God" changed my life.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Hi, Dad.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Why didn't she thank you?
About you and mom?
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
I know what you're up to.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
What now, Sayer?
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Good morning, Simone.
A star is...
Wow. They called you their son.
Why, Malcolm?
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
You're a doctor. What kind?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
...No.
What do you want more than anything?
I have to.
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Don't cry.
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Just help.
Someone got hurt.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
I don't know how else to look--
How did you--?
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Get off his case sweetie.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Carl, what are you doing?
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
"Peggy-Sue" --
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
"With a hack-hack here --"
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Is that right?
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
What about Jeremiah?
So?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Getting ready.
Wait a minute --
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Where's Mac?
Carl.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
How are you going to find him?
Sorry.
Grant, where'd you go?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
What?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Hey there, Chief.
Meat.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Flip.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
What are you doing?
When one sees you they all see you.
What's he get if he wins here?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Why're you driving so fast?
Who'd want to?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
What the hell's going on?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
What the hell are you doing?!?
Mississippi's the other way!
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
He's just exhausted.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Loud and clear.
Shit! No one's here.
Hit the brakes!
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
-- How we doing?
Bandit II?
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
I think you're just yellow.
Shut up, Fred.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Oh.
Five thou.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
You're sure?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
I'm here, where's the car?
So I guess you're not going.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
FUCK YOU!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
I can't discuss --
You're finished.
...Does he know?
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
I wouldn't go that far.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Why?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
Gibarian.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Why would you let her to do that?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
How much sleep do you need?
Probably.
What will you say?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
I need to see Snow.
Don't.
We're taking a flight?
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
You want to fuck her?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You're better when you take them.
You still don't believe in God?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
He has a point.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
What's wrong.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
But we fought.
Was she right?
What's wrong?
That won't happen again.  We're different.
No.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
You're lying.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Where did you go before?
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
Looks a little constipated to me.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Straight ahead.
Uh...
Right.  That's true.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Are you nervous?
Let's get a drink.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You all right?
I'm sorry about what happened.
Claire?
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Yeah.
No dog.
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Claire?
Yeah.
I don't know you...
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Claire...
What a memory.
"For"...?
... Mike.
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
I'll miss you, Mike.
Say goodbye, Mike.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
For how long?
Honey.  You got him.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
At my house...!
You should'a brought the girl.
How do I know that's her?
Let my kid go.
Watch your step!
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Nice threads Dad.
How about dinner tonight?
She's what?
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Here you go, Pete.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I was there.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Now tell me you love me.
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Can't focus...
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
What are you doing this weekend?
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
You'd feel what?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Toxic dumps, huh.
Of course.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I am old enough to--
I'll introduce you.
Absolutely no class.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Peter, what can I do for you?
Your dog ate it.
How much do you know about it?
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
They never caught on.
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Ready?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Private property, bub.
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Have a cigar.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Jawohl.
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
You can say that again!
Let me go! Let me go!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
You did?
To the Brick Kremlin!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Grable, not Gable!
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
What about Schulz?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Says me.
Lay off, Sefton.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Right.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
How do they know?
Who did?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Shapiro. Shapiro.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
Ach so!
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
Where is he now?
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Left behind?
Soran?
Where is he now?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
We don't have a tractor beam.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Aye.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Doctor Soran?
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Still no response, sir.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
I don't believe it...
Same sector. Metallic mass.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
My readings indicate great instability.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Captain, what's happening?!
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Mr. Scott...
Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Genesis planet is gone.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Count on our help, sir.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Would you look at that?
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Yours...?!
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
No.
Yes, I was...
But -- why?
I ordered no interruptions.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
My Lord... what are your orders?
Sir, may I --
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Say thank you.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
I still don't under --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Wait --
Jim --
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
It was just words.
What are you looking at?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're still running with shields down.
They won't --
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
... No response, sir.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Not enough against their shields.
A distinct possibility.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
What IS working around here?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Spock!
... the good of the few...
I failed to resolve the situation.
Admiral?
<u>WHAT</u>?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Admiral on the bridge!
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Stop engines.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Admiral on the bridge --
We are clear and free to navigate.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
You lied.
I do this because I was there,
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
That's crazy!
An experimental device, doctor.
Hi... Busy?
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
What's causing that!?
The top of what?
I do not know your name.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
No choice now, Scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Status report, Admiral!
So you were at Berkeley.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
How will that be done, exactly?
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
There is a 20th Century possibility.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Spock...
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Status?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Warp two... three...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Aye, sir. Descending.
Ready sir.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
I'll have to re-energize.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
I am well, Admiral.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
Jak'tahla?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Why not...?
Won't he rust?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Very funny...
Hello, Data...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
How many?
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
You're not going to launch anything until...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
That's your expert opinion?
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Would you like something to eat?
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
You need a haircut, Commander.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
What you're doing to my neck...
Come in.  Hi.
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
... I'm not sleeping well...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Montana.  Energize.
It's Cochrane.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
You actually performed surgery...?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Do you know what this is, Data?
No. I will not betray my friends.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Isn't it better like this...?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
I have helm control.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Ready to make a little history?
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Their com system must still be down.
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
What makes you say that?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
We?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
You're leaving, aren't you?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Report.
They're bypassing Engineering...
Even Data?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Figures.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
It takes a lot of effort.
He's a DOCTOR!
And what did they tell you?
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
She's here - somewhere.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
How much time's left of your sentence?
I know how to get outside the shield.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Aft thrusters -
Aye, sir.
Kronos, sir?
I always wanted to try that.
Captain, our shields -- !
Who is "US?"
According to my information, today.
We HAVEN'T fired -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
But I am not human. I am only -
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Uhura?
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
You must have faith.
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
A lie?
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Trouble?
Sir?
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
NO WAY!
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
Indefinitely.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
How long does he have?
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
So... To happy endings.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
To new worlds...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
A weapon.
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Why am I looking at me?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Yes.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
What is our approximate distance?
No.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?

It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
New Praetor?
Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Sir --
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Sir?
Praetor?
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
It's not quite the face you remember.
Were we always explorers?
Looking up at the stars.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
With a full head of hair.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
What are you doing?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Intruder alert!
The bond is broken.
How many Warbirds will you need?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Right in line with that burning tree.
You have one with two beds?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
What do you think of America?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
Where's that?
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Please...
Dashboard.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Closed?
Who are you?
Who?
I am husband?
Who?
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Horses.
Yes.
But I must go here.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Yes.
The captain...
Do you have music up there?
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
Asshole!!
No one's traveling in this weather.
You are cold.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Where do you think you're going?
Help me!!!
You sure this is your car?
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Tell him I'm not here.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
You married, Major?
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Hello...
Bullshit politics.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
You have to go.  I mean it.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
What kind of things exactly?
Talk to me about costs, here.
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
You should feel like shit.
Looks like she was holding out.
Whattya mean?
What stuff?
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Charm.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
What the fuck are you doing?
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
No more, Lenny.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
This is bad.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
You see Tran?
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Besides that.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Agent Mackelway.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
You tell me.
What does the Manager say?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
He was sitting here?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
We have another one.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I'm hesitant to...
There was talk of a file photo.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Thanks for the ride.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Yes I do.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
He thinks he looks young.
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
The tattoo?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
All the same killer?
What happened?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
Suspect Zero?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Is he dead?
Was it Zero?
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Thomas Mackelway.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
No.
Speck is dead.
But why attack an Agent?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Yeah.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
What else?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Hi.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
On the table.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I miss you, Mike.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
So what's the difference?
I mean, I need the money.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
I'll give you an eight.
Sounds more like Aids...
I'll get a Dewars rocks...
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Darwinism at its best.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Uuuuugh!
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
They turned you down?
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
It's kinda money, actually.
She was cute.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
Are you ready to order?
That's right.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
We're going to Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
They're all skanks.
Always.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Christy was nice...
She didn't like me, anyway.
...a day...
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
I hear she's getting real fat.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
No.
What time's this party tonight?
Which one?
What are you doing?
You looked right at her, baby.
We got the digits, baby.
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Yes she did.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Anaheim...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Shut up, Sue...
It's on...
It's on.
...Okay, two...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
The Court gave you justice.
Godfather.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Good for ten men...
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
You take care of your family?
Is it necessary?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Things went badly in Palermo?
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
Give them some money and send them home.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
They're talking to themselves.
You like spaghetti?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
What time do they expect us?
I LOVE YOU.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Tell me!
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Do you wish to be baptized?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
How do you do.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
We?
Shut up.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
He's drowning me!
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
I'm intruding.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
You like jazz!
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
You're breaking my ribs!
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
How?
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Hello?
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Dickie!
Oh my God. Tom.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Dickie?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I told you. He gave them to me.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
I told you! I knew it!
How would you know that?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
Is this you?
What's your secret?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
What?
So -- are you travelling under R?
Ditto.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
What rumour?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
I've been backpacking.
He's already angry, I don't think --
Tom, are you okay?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Or Tom and Peter even.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
A few days ago.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Absolutely.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
You like ball games?
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Why?
Yes?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Really?
What did you do?
Huh?
That would have been quite a coincidence.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
The singer?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
But this is a porno movie.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
But... Betsy...
Hello, Travis.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Try holding the match like this.
Oh, are you all right?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
He's Black, OK?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I'm serious, really...
Yeah.
Huh?
I have.
Well... I guess so.
What's your name?
I don't remember.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
But that one night?
Where?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Also clean.
Is that so?
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
Anything you say, officer.
Wiz?
Stick with Carla.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
No.
Maybe.  Not really.
He's got a gun, sir.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Limp dick?
Wait.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Surprise, surprise.
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Hi.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Whoa.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
When did you start smoking?
They're not bad.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Yes... yes, I do.
Yes it does.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
No wallet, huh?
Are you saying that he's...
No.  But...
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Didn't you have any help?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Beautiful, wasn't it?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Zackly.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Jesus.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
When'd you quit smoking?
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
That was beautiful.
I can play the piano?
Sit.  Play with me.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Found me.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
What happened?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Ancestors?
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
San Francisco.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Then what was it?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Is smoking fun?
Could I have a puff?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Are you coming to my party?
Don't you like us?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Why are they trying to kill people?
What?
No, it's Lois!
Yes, but where?
I see. How do I get down there?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Daniels.
Yes.
Yes?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Gulls!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
You did say birds?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
She was selling birds.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Yes?
When do you think they'll come?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
Mitch...
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Where's Mitch?
No.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Does this room look silly?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
What did you say?
I don't know you.
How?
When?
I didn't break that window!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
Do you practice here?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Yes.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Will I be seeing you again?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
But not for me.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I do different things on different days.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Last night? What do you mean?
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
It's so damn quiet out there.
I keep thinking of Annie.
Do you want to try your father again?
What time is it?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Yes, certainly.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Birds?
I haven't finished my drink.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I'm Donald Fettes.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You must leave this house.
He's not home.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
But Richardson?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
We can't be sure of that.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
See that, Fettes?
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
This is not a woman!
Are you a doctor, too?
Hear him?
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
No.
It might be an interesting case.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
But what makes a thought start?
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
This is a gift.
What did you hear?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
Was the paralysis immediate?
Crony indeed!
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Two down. Two to go.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
The scar. Which of you has it?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
... it connects you to me...
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
You know.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
What is it?
It still doesn't mean...
You killed her!
Sweetheart...
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Such power exists?
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Hi Mom!
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
You think they'll ever find him?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
We certainly did.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
You know about the United Nations?
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
I don't know how to thank you.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Oh -- hello--
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
What is it you want?
Just twelve.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
I was.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
All day.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Where is she?!
What is this, David?
You can't kill me, Star.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
I thought they'd be in coffins.
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Good!
Are we havin' fun or what?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Okay?
Sure.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
We're getting close...
Tell them to get something to eat.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
He met a girl.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Where's Michael?
What did you say?
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Ohmygod...
Say hello to Thorn.
Not impressed, are you?
Max... what are you talking about?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
I guess you're new around here.
Let's go see them.
David's looking for me... I have to go.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone.  I feel it!
This is kind of a cool place.
This room is mine.
You're beautiful.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What's the matter?
Sixteen.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Now why'd you go and...
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
We got to burn 'em.
Let's open it.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch them!!
MacReady!
What are you doing?
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
I think so.
Neither will we.
Well, who's got access to it?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Hey, man...!
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
What's...
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Tie up Clark, too.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
What is it?
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Maybe it ain't coming.
Get your gear on.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
Now how did you get hurt?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
My God... I saw this.
Vox?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
What's your name?
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Why would you let me go back?
So you take their best...
You took her because she helped me.
Now will you go?
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm tired of running.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
I know it's not a diamond but --
Alex, what is it?
Let's walk through the park...
My God...
I was not.
In the future, we'll be better.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
Oh, that explains everything.
Good night, then.
This is magnificent...
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Yes... I suppose so.
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Yes, sir, he --
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
And roosters.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
He said he traveled for two months.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
You know that's not true.
You won't even try?
If I might explain, sir --
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Should we be...
Relax.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
[Beat] You're his son?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
I don't understand...
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
You done with your small talk?
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Jackie, go play in the snow.
I think I can remember what's on them.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
How'd he die?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Do you really believe me?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
You're sure?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
My God you look exactly like him.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
Exactly.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
Why not?
And how do you know that?
How do you know about Eugene?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
It's gonna be sticky.
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
No.
You want a drink?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
I'm sorry.
Have a good day at work today.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Darryl.
Honey?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
What did ya do?
You're a bank robber?
Tell me.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Is this your car?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Exactly.
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
But you think he fools around.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
So what are you gonna tell him?
How do I look?
What happened to your hair?
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Thelma.
I want you to call Darryl.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Now what?
Whaddo we do?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
This is so beautiful.
What?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
You do?
I said all that?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
No.
We can live in a hacienda.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
What in the hell is that up there?
What in the hell is it?!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Then let's not get caught.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
I'm not apologizing for shit!
We're fine!  How are you?
Yeah... sure did.
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Whatever happened to Mary?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
No You mean...?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Check.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Here's the info you asked for.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh yeah.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
How about -- ?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Urrggghh...
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Jai alai?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
How do you guarantee that?
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
An old flame?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I think you'd better sit down.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
By the way, how's he doing?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Hey.
You look great.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Piggyback ride.
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
And?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
And the second condition?
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
What's happened?
How's my favorite President?
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
So what've we got today?
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Yeah.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Mr. Clear Moon.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
I got one up on ya.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Her oil pan is shot.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Tread matches. It's the car.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Jesus. Oil?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
This Clear Moon's house?
You're the Indian FBI.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Thank you.
What?
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
Do you want a coffee?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
Where did you see that?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
Yes, ma'am.
The what?
It never came up.
What if he's not?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
You ever think about killing another human being?
Does it bother you?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
You want to go ballistic?
Food...and you...my F-14!
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Tomcats?
Let's hope you're right!
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
I'm pulling up.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Did what?
That's not what I heard.
So I've heard.
You think you can stay up with us.
How was it?
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
What are you doing?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
You ever done this before?
We did it!
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we're next.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
ON THE NOSE?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
Figured it out yet?
Need a hint?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
It was bad.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Why?
I can take care of myself.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You may not think so, but you are.
Where's yours?
So, where to?
First time on Mars?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
What do you want?
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
I'm with an very important client.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
Your sexual orientation?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Amazing.  Where are we?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
On his way.
They found us!  Everybody out!
Yeah.
No shit...
What trip?
I did?
What are you, my father?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where is he?
Would you please repeat the destination?
Lori...
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
--I got a trip to Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
The hell you're not.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
All right.
I give up.
I'm not interested in that.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
I said get out!
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
What's wrong?
You guys all set?
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Knock it off, Burt!
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You didn't cook breakfast?
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Oh, Jesus!!
Fuck you!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Son of a bitch!
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
You go north, I'll go south.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Use the fucking bomb!
Somebody paying you to do this?
Burt!  Heather!
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Think it's still following us?
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Gimme back my bottle.
Objection.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Oh really?
You can't remember that -- !
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
-- an angel dust dealer --
Ten years is a long time.
What other case?
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
-- Easy as that, huh?
Do you have to do that?
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Eddie Dowd.
-- What?
So what're we gonna do?
Let's get a cab.
...Jesus!
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I embellished.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
-- Find him?
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
You do.
My mother find you?
Figures.
I killed the motherfucker.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
...I'm dying out there.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
'lo, Cecil.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
No.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
Tell me some other things about her.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
We can do it right here.
Well, where are you going?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
OK, Gordon.
Phillip?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Where is the ring?
He didn't suffer.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
A blue rose.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
I see. He does talk loud.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
What is it?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Goodbye, Muffin.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Laura, I am your friend.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
Why do you do it, Laura?
You missed somethin', Ed.
Bob.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
James...
This afternoon?
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
Bobby killed a guy.
No.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Can I take the car?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Leland, what are you doing?
Leland...
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
He was accused of jury tampering.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
What is the truth?
What are you doing here?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
You would not...?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
What book is that?
How old are you?
Objection, we've...
Objection!
No further questions.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
We went to Code Blue...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
And you wrote that...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
One hour.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
D'you find an apartment?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Really. How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Do you think it's my fault?
And it's over...?
Not if you don't grow up...
Is it over?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
It's a long road that has no turning.
...hey, I don't need your charity...
Who have we got?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Been a long time, huh...?
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
That's right.
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What are you doing in New York...?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I just saw her.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Hey, how about that!
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I do know him...slightly.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
The troops are certainly moving in here!
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Is that... machine...?
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
What is that gizmo?!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
We will, sir!
They are living creatures out there.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
What'll we say to 'em?
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
One of mom's cups got broken.
Just be careful, okay?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
These look quite fresh.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Darker.  More...evil?
When do you think it'll be done?
Freddy, for all I know.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Yes?
Uh...sure...when?
Now?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You sound so sure.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Carry on.
There's still a way.
Albatross?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
You okay?
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You know, I never had friends like this.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Passport?
Good.
What'd you do?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
About yourself?
It's outta here!
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
They are much more than that, sir.
For killing a dolphin.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
I'm from all over.
No.
No.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
No... I don't think so, man.
Whattaya mean family?
No shit?!?! You know him?
What'd you say?
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
So, it's back to the islands.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
What happened on the charges?
But I'm wild at heart.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Hasta siempre.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
What brand'd she smoke?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
They sure do stink.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
What's that, peanut?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
You got me, peanut.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
How much we got left, honey?
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
You knew my daddy?
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Now what?
So where'd you say you was?
I mean tomorrow.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
He's the kind liked it.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
LULA!!!!
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Just tell me what you want.
You need to explain it.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
You got nice tits.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I know... I remember.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He lives with his mother.
That was good.
What's this guy's problem?
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
No...
I'll be... somewhere else.
Is that in my chart?
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
You cold, James?
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Want me to get that?
The guy on the phone.
Afraid so.
Professor Tripp?
How did I get here last night?
How's that?
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
So, why did you take me up there?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
You coming?
It's because you don't eat.
Where you going?
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
Thanks for that. He all right?
Hey.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
I'm sure.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
You heard? How?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Walter?
Is it good?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Who's that guy?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Maybe I should read it.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Where you stand?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Hardapple?
Are you riding with me, James?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Foreman now.
Five years.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
What are you doing?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Ah, come on.
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
It's not what you think.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Nothing.
There's a million birds here.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
What does that mean?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Hiya, Walter.
You don't know?
I would.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Too much sun.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
You walked home.
Do you believe in them?
I wasn't feeling well.
What's with the boxes?
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I'd keep away from him.
Yes.
Walter?
That's right.
How's the journal?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
How long is this going to take?
Will I ever be normal?
Do you know what "normal" is?
How do you define it?
I don't know.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Please don't do it again.
To relax.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
No, I am not going to --
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Sorry.  Where is she?
But roughly, how old?
And what are you doing?
A nap?
Don't ever do that again.
I'm only asking questions.
Did you get an erection?
How do you feel about that?
I'm talking about you.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
You never spoke to me before.
Southern light.
They could eat you.
So?
So, you're not a dyke.
Did I say something wrong?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Are you serious?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Thank you.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Where are we?
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You never did like being called that, did you?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
But what did he see that made him panic?
Need some help?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You totaled it, huh?
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Alright, put this on.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Hippy, you pussy.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Stand by on the ROV.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Shall we go for a swim?
Nothing... nothing at all!
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes, you should go.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Then why do you say them?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Why don't you try?
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Whose boat is that?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Why have we stopped?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Zuria?
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Because...
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
But she watches... she listens.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
And you like that?
No. I was sick.
Something I ate.
Down... there.
Yes.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
From God.
I... I don't understand.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Anything?
Would you like some?
Where do you think babies come from?
You liked Sister Paul?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?  Mmm?
She's dead isn't she?
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
What?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
How did you have a baby?
Did you want it to come out?
Why?
Why?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
And then what happened?
A crucifix.
No.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Which one?
Do you remember what just happened?
So I could go to him.
Are you frightened?
Stay away from me...
Not your fault...
I hate him for what he did to me.
What did you do?
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
I don't know.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Martha, it's you.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Do you still go to church?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Is that normal?
How did she hide it during the day?
Who was the father?
What's his name?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
Who?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
???
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
What?
Sister Paul?
Like keeping her home from school?
I haven't decided yet.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Fine thanks...
Mary Magdelen?
Do you want to become one?
May I be present?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
The baby?
And the baby.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
The usual ten per cent?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah.
Can you fix him for me?
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
We're nearly there, sir.
Me? Why?
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Did you look in here?
Sure. .
What's up?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Should I say it?
What are we waiting for?
No, I didn't you did ...
Are you supposed to be here?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Are you pulling my leg?
I see.  Do you like the play?
Thank you.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
They ought to be.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And what's it all come to in the end?
Where are you off to?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
Yeah ... so what?
Well, what are we waiting for?
That little old man.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Give 'em a pull.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Oh you are, I know you are.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
He belongs to Paul.
Well ...
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Paul's grandfather.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Oh... God... am I cold...
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Where's Irth?
I got it.  Oh boy.
Can you get it a little closer?
Gravity?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
Yes?  What is it?
Why, what's wrong?
What do you mean?
Okay.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
It's really on there tight.
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
It's clear.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
He's running a fever.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What do you mean, no?
What's happening up here?
That must have been when he got it.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Air lock?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
That sounds a little fanciful...
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
How?
I thought I'd find you here.
They're getting pretty close now.
Okay.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Where are we?
Let's hear it.
What the hell happened?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
But?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Engaged.
We won't need it then.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Where are you?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
Let's hear it.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No... don't...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Headache?  Dehydration?
What is it?
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
It's a rhino.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
What's going on?
It's too late!
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
What the hell are you doing?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Still got him?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Is this the suit?
And...?
Already working on it.
There's still time to back-out.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Six month stint on Datus.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Think I spoke too soon...
What?
Where'd you leave them?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Hungry?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
What do you mean by that?
I can't believe my ears...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
No, it's not.  It's for this.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Let's go sit by the piano.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Just slipped your mind.
Take care of yourself out there...
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
I'll check with Eve...
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Thank you.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Paranoiac!
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
With the paper to prove it.
Hello, what's your name?
Just wondered what?
Why what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
Why not?
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
Late for what?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
It was for my report.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
May I have your coat?
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Oh, but there is-
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
I think I know...
You talk just as Addison said you did.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
How'd hear about it?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
She's just outside the door.
Margo, really...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
With tears?
Coming?
That's on time for Margo.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
If we could cast it properly, that is...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Well of all-
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I never said it was!
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
Yes, sir.
Hello..
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
You get quick action, don't you?
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Are you breaking the contract?
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
What's that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
See her?  Get anything?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
I hate both parties.
Who'd you vote for?
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
Goddamnit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--Jesus--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
Morning or night?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Tell that to Muskie.
But you know who did.
Can't help you.
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
Hey... very tense.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
FBI too?
Hey, easy...
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Who by?
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Right.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Just tell me his title.
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
They are not my clients.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
There were more then.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Anything?
--which Young?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
Go on.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
What do you suppose they're saying?
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
You don't like it?
What?  No I'm not.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
So we're gonna be close next year?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
You're missing the game for us?!
I think I've had one.
...I've never tried it.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
No comment.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Are you kidding?  No.
Gotta go.
Like a bet?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Hey, where's Finch?
Hey, minuteman.
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Yes.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Shame on you!
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Jim...
Ho-lee shit.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
That's my trick!
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
That was a great night.
What?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Contact, dude.
Feeling better, Oz?
Kevin, it was just a --
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Bullshit.  From where?
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Ha-ha!
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Like an underground club?
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
We don't both have to die.
What does it say?
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Another step and he's dead!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Because Gaston was after it.
Uncle Terrence?
Jesus...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Shit. I feel sick.
Andy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
What've you got?
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Saint Severin...
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Who did you hear it from?
Noooo....
Did I tell you that?
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
You must enjoy causing me pain!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
How is our current financial status?
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
What do you want?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Singer!
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Yes.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Alvy, I...
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
For yuh.
Oh, you do?
Oh, right.
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Your grammy!
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Oh, I see, I see.
Fifteen years, huh?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
I know.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
No.  You're a wreck.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.
Yeah?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
And blind people, crippled...
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
You see, like you and I...
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
I know you've only known me a short while.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Oh, you have my body.
Yeah.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
I'm home!
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
David! David! I can't believe this!
I'm following you and David, if you-
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Yeah, where is the spider?
Is he in the bathroom?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
God.
God, it's so clean out here.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
What?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
This is my room.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Tsch, a few.
I can think of another word.
I mean that as a compliment.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Oh.
Charlie Chaplin.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Stop calling me Max.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
I have some very good memories there.
Oh.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
What's the matter?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
M'hm.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
You fired the cleaning woman?
But she's colored.
So the colored have enough trouble.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Uh, how did this personality come about?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Was it a contractor?
So who won?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
What's that?
It's going.  It's going.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
The movie.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
I'm not.
Why didn't you bring him?
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
So where is young Jonah?
What is that thing?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Directing suits you.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Just did.  Jealous?
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
Stupid tart.
You need to call your dad.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
We've heard lots about you.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
There's a test, you know.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
I'm fine, babe.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
Not millions.
Take your time, Jer.
Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Kiss the back of my knees.
What?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Still champions.
Dolphins.  Great.
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis!!!!
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
About me!
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Anyone else?
Don't.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Happy anniversary.
I know.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Joking.
Please, Ryan.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I need to leave you now.
What am I, five?
That's very nice.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
How do you do, Skye?
Ryan.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
I'm so sorry.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
I was impressed.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Panes is here!
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
We're just feeling our way back.
Everyday.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
You're a shit.
Why not?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
You don't need to do that.
Enough about me.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
She's such a great photographer.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Well good.  Thank God.
What do you mean, thank God?
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Someone who follows his heart!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You're right!
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Worker!  Come back here now!
So what makes you so special?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Who is that idiot?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Yes, what else?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Ask me why we're so successful.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Wear this.
This the place?
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Say, you got a lulu.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Twenty-seven.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Good night.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
Sure.
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
Eight-thirty.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Three.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
What's your friend's name?
Your stomach?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Cut.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Who was that?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Are you all right?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Who?
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
You like?  It's all yours.
Yes, sir.
Don't mind what?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
On account of me.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
You can't come in.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
How do you spell her last name?
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
What's this -- you packing?
Who is Mickey?
Family?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Say, this is Snugsville.
No kidding.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Good night?
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
I want you back, Fran.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Who the hell are you?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Yeah.
Chef.
And the grass?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Can I go get those mangos now?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
What does that mean ?
Terminate ?
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
What's your name, sailor ?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Fucking savages.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Were you with him, when...
What's that?
He'll kill us.
No -- no, Captain.
You hear it again?
You think he'd of shot us?
What?
Captain Willard?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
30   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
117  CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:
113  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
212  CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
39   CONTINUED:
My dad was a Navy doctor.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Did you catch Corbett?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
That's not what I meant.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Be careful, okay?
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Does he have people?
Surviving is what I know --
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
What's wrong?
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Meaning he'll need a plane.
There's what they're waiting on!
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I know. He's just the best.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Sorry.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
What about your mother?
Why did yo do this for me?
No, sir...
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
I was going to do that for you.
Thanks, Melvin.
Stop asking everyone.
You wanna dance?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
I'll never forget you said it.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Can you not be violent?
No!!!
But what about...
Help!
You changed the room around...
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
She's nice.
What?
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Actually, I don't think so.
Terrify me?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Would you leave now, please?
That's very thoughtful.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
I told you to go on in.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
What did she say?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Why are you doing this?
Is there a problem?
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
What are you doing?
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
Game over, bitch!
Michael?
Who?
How did he know?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Deadline?
Hello, Robert.
What does that mean?
Who is that other guy?
Why?
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Electra.
With computers.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
I was just different.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Do you have a passport?
No.
Do you think about the game?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Really?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Two way?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Then, we wait.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
What?
I told you, he will.
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
Do you have ulcers?
They're worth less points.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
What are you doing?
Yes.
Attraction is a complication?
Is this becoming complicated?
When did it start?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
That doesn't sound normal.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I prefer it like this.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
What are you having?
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
But we are underground?
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Fifteen crowns.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
No, why?
It must be on the other side of this.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Nope.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
I don't want to ruin your day.
God, I think I need a holiday.
You're sure?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Turned Czech huh?
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
No, I love you, really.
If you get out can we be together again.
But we could go to London and live in England.
Forget about me Kat.
Yeah, for sure.
About forty minutes.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
You mean it's started?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Where did you steal the car?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Sure!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Come on Holly!
Have you lost all control of this city?
It could help with a new car --
You look nice. I should have dressed.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Were you with Jamie?
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
What are you doing here?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
The address?!
Deranged.
You.
Get yourself a glass.
You don't know me.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Yeah.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
He doesn't trust you.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
He okay?
People can see.
All of it.
So you're talking to me?
She great or what?
Like fire.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
I might do it wrong.
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
From citizen high to citizen low.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
But if you could, you would?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Did you give him a gift?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
You've been well?
Now I can do what I want.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Here's your jacket!
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Why what?
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You have a name?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
An atomic bomb.
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I know.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
What year is this?
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Pretty, isn't it?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Gone?... Where?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
What'd they look like?
You lost that one?
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
You like people?
Then why'd you do it?
Good luck to you.
No, you're not either.
Okay.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
You still in school?
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Hi.
You're a redhead.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Why not?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Don't call me stupid.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
What'd you put him in there for?
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
No.
Yes.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Hi.
This your place?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Fine.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
You tossed my hat out the window.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
There's another one we owe 'em.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
Apache?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
The girl I remind you of.
Another 'you'?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Never.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Pictures don't lie.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Let him go.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
If you could, I'd 
Well I have to come up with  an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
...Hello.
Yeah, he's funny that way.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 
I'm a writer. Ted O 
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
What do you do far a living?
What do you mean, Barton?
...That's fine.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
Yeah, but 
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
What do you think happened?
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Jesus... They can tell that...
Jesus... You're leaving.
Sure, Charlie.
But Charlie  why me? Why 
...Yes, thank you.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Fink.
Transient or resident?
Is this multiple choice?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Yeah, I was drinking.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How are you, Nick?
How about the booze?
No?
Catherine Tramell.
I need a cigarette.
Who?
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
What is this interest you've got in her?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
How long were you dating him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Yes, you do.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Did I miss something?
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
You like playing games, don't you?
Because you didn't love him --
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
What did you pay Nilsen?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Aren't you going to thank me?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
Can I talk to you a minute?
No.
I'm writing a book.
Why not?
Why?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
You workin' on another book?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Nope, can't say that I do.
I never heard of him.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
What you doin', son?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't think it's funny.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You look like dogshit.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Naa..
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
How much for these five?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Would you like to see the wine list?
Paint it out.
 In this corner?
Who's that?
Check you later, man.
What's the rush, John Henry?
I don't really have any problems.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
Drugs??!
You do! You definitely do.
What's wrong with me?
Don't you think he's using you?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
Hi.
See you later.
No, I'd like the scarf.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? What do you want?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
That one's for you.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
OK! Goodbye!
I need this?
Uh-oh!
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Admiring your handiwork?
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Didn't I say that?
Pouring myself into my work.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
No.  No glass on the inside.
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
What happened?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Son!
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Working late?  I'm touched.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
Uncle Alfred?
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Women.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Please be looking for me.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
This is easy.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Watch the first step.
How did you...?
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
You're not even listening to me.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
No gun.  How disarming.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
...A bat.
What now sir?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
Why's that?
He's home. I sent the signal.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Mr...?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
So glad you could come.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
La'chiem.
Rinka.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
To kill me.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Fast work. You just moved here.
Why do you do that?
Touchy, touchy.
I don't-.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Back off, man.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
_We_ sure are.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
No.  Wait...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Can't we --
Please.
What is that?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
Keep her on the line!
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
Joker here. Can we talk?
... Thank you.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Yum, yum.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
There aren't hotels?
It's the last thing we need.
It isn't working any more, David.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Big day today, huh? 78
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Howls he getting on with the family?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Say that again, son.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Bye, Dad.
But is she gonna be okay?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Shut up, Kevin.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
We're gonna get paid to score.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
That's not that much.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Uh... bye-bye.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Does that say Xanax?
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Talk ta me, Bork.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Not on him, Chief.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Who sent ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
She's ready.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Anything happen while I was away?
Handbook for the recently diseased.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Oh, honey, we may need that.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
My God, we're back where we started.
I feel really stupid.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What...?
Aren't you scared?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Did you get the paint?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
This is <u>my</u> town.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
What about Betelgeuse?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Three syllables.
Beetle!
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
W... What is it?
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Stepmother's...
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Okay?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
He does, does he?
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
A Black man gave me the message.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Did you lose something?
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... Good night, Chauncey.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Yes.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I feel very good in here.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Bravo!
Certainly, Ben.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Good morning, Louise.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Have you served in the Army?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... How are the kids getting along?
I can certainly understand that...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
... Would you take me on a tour?
... What do you make of all this?
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I don't know.
Morning.
Enjoy.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Hi.
Did you eat?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Now?
I have to go back.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
So how was it? What was he doing?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Tell her you need to see her.
My God!
The monkey.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I know.
So how was it?
I know. I'm sorry...
Pardon?
Mr. Juarez?
Security.
No.
No. I understand perfectly.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Moving story.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Somebody told you.
That's the usual?
Lotte? Is that you?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
What kind of circumstances?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Forget it.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
We have to meet.
Who's calling?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Vegas.
Sleepy suddenly.
Bad dream, darling?
Yeah what?!
Captain Mertin?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
What you want?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Should I wake her?
MAMA!
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Jesus.
Leave off..
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Sethe?
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Her life is in your hands.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
The Gundersons.
Excuse me?
What's this?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Yeah.
He peed on the Dude's rug--
I am the Walrus.
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Burkhalter.
Kill that poor woman.
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Am I wrong?
What do you need that for, Dude?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Please!  Please!
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
No.  Here.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Oh yeah?
"Johnson"?
Well--sure, I could do that--
She most certainly was not!
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Jeffrey--
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
So...that doctor.
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Just for making the hand-off?
Have it your way.  The point is--
Oh shit.  Walter.
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
Walter--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
No.
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Huh?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Oh, shit.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
There weren't any shots.
Call the medics, Dude.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Is this a--what day is this?
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Walter--
how long since he was bitten?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
You're hurting me.
What do you want me to do?
What do you think?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
You want me to hunt them for you.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
From his father, of course.
Yes?
Any casualties?
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Who dies first?
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
You shouldn't be here.
What are you doing?!
What are you looking at?
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
It's dark in here.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Is he sick?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Get out of here --
How's it going, Kam?
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
Please --
You don't have to be.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
What happens then?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Domini?
What're you doing there?
Why?
No!
--I'm not staying here!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
Druid Hill Park.
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What'd you dream?
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
--hours before--
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't know yet.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Never would've guessed.
Me, too.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Nobody's going anywhere--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
What?
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
What?
Why?
Pointless.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What'd you see?
Cotter'll kill you.
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
I should check on Anna.
What the fuck's going on here?
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
Your mother's pastor.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Uh-huh.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
Why didn't you get into bed?
...That's what's important.
...You leaving?
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
I told you. I like you.
Well now you do.
...What was that back there?
Sign.
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
Yeah...
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Pour that back.
This.
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Got a problem, Meurice?
...Why?
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Frank. Come in.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Come into the study a minute.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
What is this? What color is it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
Not yet.
Yes, but.
Bull.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Shit. You better tell me something.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Look.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Do you like my body?
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I guess I should go.
I don't want to go.
Heineken.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
How is Central these days?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
O.K.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
What did you see?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
Okay. be careful.
What am I going to do?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
You worry about me really?
What was that all about?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I should go with her, Sandy.
I'm going out for awhile.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
On the plane.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Que va hacer?
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Surprise.
Tuna, this is crap.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Mirtha.
What the fuck is that?
I don't know...
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I don't think so.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
You?
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Oh my G-d.
Diego?  It's George.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
But you must.  It's the only way.
I know.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
George.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
In how long?  A week?
Yeah, layaway.
Barbara.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Layaway shmayaway.
Yeah.  Nice.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
I want money.
Freedom.
Money.
Diego?
Just low.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
You're not going to trial?
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Figured it out.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
But this is...
Alright.
Not in front of the kid.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Well, here I am.  See?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
But I have a visitor.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
For instance, something like this?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Third group. What's your assignment?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
What's happened to you?
Read it.
No ...
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Why?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What can we prove?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Then how did it get into his body?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
What did they argue about?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Can you?
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Can I go?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
She was here?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What kind of information?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Did he make your life miserable?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I suppose.
Who told you that?
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
How?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
How'd you meet Marsh?
-- And then?
You and me -- making love.
Why would she lie?
Alone?
You were brilliant today.
You killed him -- didn't you?
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
Michael -- get off the phone.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
Can't it wait?
Humped
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
Yes.
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
Please -- not now.
It's more involved than that.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Don't say that!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Carolyn!
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
She's changed.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Madge?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Roseman Bridge?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
This time of year.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
And how long are you here for?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Is the dizziness gone?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
You ought to write these stories down.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You drink bug repellent?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
But no one in particular.
I'll pick you up.
It's Robert.
Oh.
Yeah?
How about if I set the table?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Where was she?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
STOP IT!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
I don't know. Please...
Where you going?
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm positive.
Betty.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
When did she decide this?
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Is it true?
Hey, kid.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Is this Hell?
That's what?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
I said, no thanks.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Let me see your hand.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Jimmy, you've got --
I want you to do something for me, baby.
But.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
Have you ever been inside?
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
I lied.
Are they on the radio?
And you believe her?
Cinn?
I can't.  Not yet.
Where is it?
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
What the hell do you want?
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Sit down, Gino!
Oh, shit ...
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
It's impossible!
You can't leave.
Tell them!  Tell them!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Fuck.
Shut up, Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Shut up, Violet.
But everybody is all right.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Not on duty, sorry.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Is that the money?
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
'63 Chevy.
Do you know him?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
No.
He's a launderer?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Then what?  Exactly.
What?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Where will you be?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
There is no going back.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
okay, all right.
I was so afraid you ...
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
And what if I couldn't do that?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
What do you mean?
Treadstone.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
You have your passport?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
We thought you were gone for good.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
We're about an hour away.
I should go.
Okay, so...
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- just --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
Oh, Jesus...
-- we'll tell them what happened --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
You have ID?
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
Wait a minute --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
... And then some.
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
In fact, killing people -
Sorry ...
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Out of kindness.
And you're mine.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Yes we have, Jack!
How could you do this to me?
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Are you alright?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Where are you taking me?
We've got both.
Look at that - right on time.
Turn around!
Security.
We? Don't blame me!
I'm going to open it!
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
What happened to you after ...
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
That's it.
I know that.
Sod it, it's broken!
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Uh ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Hello ... hello ...
Yes?
Now look what you've done to him.
Can you fix it?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Where is she?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
IB Bangin.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
He's better.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Who is it?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Who's that?
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Backup?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He one of them?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
The family know?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Whatja doing?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Turn it off.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
Stomach again.
Shit, shit, shit...
How <u>you</u> doing?
Keep it to yourself.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Wait.
I don't like being handled.
What did they do with you?
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Hold it down, okay?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
You know what I...
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Which would you prefer?
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
He must have been great-looking, right?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Nine seconds.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Of course.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
What?
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
So who's the guy?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Okay.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Just a few questions?
Goodbye, Paul.
But thanks.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Bye, sweetie.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I had no idea she was this good.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
One year...almost one year.
They said it would be okay if...
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
I've got another story.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
I didn't think you'd make it.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
It's not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Were you going to you?
So you like me, huh?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
No.  Did he really?
What?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
I don't wan to discuss work.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
If you were an artist you could have created something!
What are you doing here?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
I'm almost ready -
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
What the hell's going on?
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
You really like it?
Let's see it.
What's up, Walter?
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Did you hear what he said?
Goodbye.
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Of course I do!
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Maybe so...
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
Man look at that get up !
Go home.
H-have a seat?
Hiya Carla.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
You might talk too much.
Whatsamatter Leonard?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
Did you see my cat?
I also saw the girl give you this.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Well I'm overjoyed.
Maxwell.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
You don't have to do anything!
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
I don't think this is gold.
Nice to feel needed.
Nice game.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
I'm fine.
I... feel.... pretty.
Which way did she go?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
What's Bobby gonna say?
What show is this?
Come on, what was it?
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
You left me a message?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Is that your car?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Things are kind of confusing.
You sure?
I didn't expect to see you.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Dress, huh?  What for?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Are you okay?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Why?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
Ow.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Oh, him.
Uh... gym.
Put your head back.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
Same one.
What!?!
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Five?
I wish you would.
Interesting.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
All right.
No THX.
Come one, that was so weird.
I don't get it.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Pike.
Hi, guys.
What... are you?
Why?  Why me?
The mark of the Coven.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Cool!
The homelesses?
Buffy, the ape-woman.
And the January Semi-formal --
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Death is like spring training?
That's my leg.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
What'd he say?
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
You should be at the game.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Your place or mine?
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
Why baseball?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Oh dear....easy honey...
God bless you.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
What's that?
Did you call me a cocksucker?
I didn't spit on you!
Why you shaking me off?
He did know.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
How come you don't like me?
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Step outside, pal.
I'd kill ya.
No way.
She's playing with my mind.
Struck out eighteen...
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Who ain't?
Ain't here.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Look at yours.
Hi, Ace.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
...been right, but who knows?
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Now this is just a signature card.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
Yeah.
No, of course not.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
No, no it's okay.
Hey, Ace.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
All right, fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You lost your control.
All right.
Yeah.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Okay?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Seven o'clock?
You go and put your things away.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Hello.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Well, sir, I was just...
It's always been our policy -
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
Okay. Just take it easy.
I'll be right back.
Any change?
...pit bosses, floor managers.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Oh, it's so soft.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Why do you need that much?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...under?
Yeah.
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I want you to let me go.
Get - get up!
I wouldn't -
Just wait there for me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Should I let her in like - ?
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Well...
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Well, I... I never tried.
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
No, no? You didn't?
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
I don't want to go to Europe.
You gotta go back out there.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Can I go in?
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
He's not here?
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Are you sure?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Hi, Jennifer.
Tell me.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Sure.
I can see that. Sure.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Let me think about that.
Hm.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Well, how 'bout that?
Do you know that?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
Right.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Well, how come I laid nine?
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Charlie M?
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
I'm positive.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Hey! Oh!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
Have we reached the epi-center?
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
What's the matter...
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
You think so?...Selina?
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Spooky.
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
I don't know what came over me.
Good morning.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
You're late.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Will you two cut it out?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
Are you guys all right?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
What's this?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
You switched license plates?
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Lady, try making some sense.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Oh won't I?
What makes you say that?
Stop throwing names at me.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
Does she wear glasses?
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Not a chance.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
What did you do?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Yes sir.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Whose money is this?
You timed that beautifully.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
What's that supposed to me?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
I'm handling it.
Know what else is in here?
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't know what you mean.
We're waiting on you.
You should've done all this before.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Negative.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
I can see the benefit in that.
Where do I turn?
We're gonna get there first.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
So let's call this the usual.
It takes all types.
He gave me a look.
What you think?
He's back, Col
Fuck off, Dave.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Are you jealous of him?
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
Did he come here too?
Even now.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Sorry, darling.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
So I'm sorry.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Happy now?
So I got it wrong, then.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
She from Scotland too?
And you're not going to tell me more?
Do you like me even a little bit?
So it's true, then?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
Good-bye, Dil
What?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Your soldier.
Yes.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Love me.
What would you do for me?
Dil!!!
Promise?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Meet Col --
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Lucky you.
Hey -- what's he like?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
She's nobody. She likes me.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Of course. I forgot.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Yes.
You OK about that?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And what's she like between the sheets?
And who is she?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Hope not.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
What do you mean you can't?
I seen your fucking face.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
C'mere.
She'd be anyone's type.
She your wife?
You make a nice couple.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
What the fuck am I doing here.
I got sent.
Now put it back in.
Who's Dil?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
You liked her?
What?
Don't think that way.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Oh, come on!
You don't look so bad in this light.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Now what?
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Then say it.
Only we call them agents.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Ours.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Café.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
What's your first name today?
Oh.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Back where?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Why you lied to me.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Sure.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Whitefoot, of course.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Or Tex?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I'd love some, thanks.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Yes.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
What do you mean, no?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
I was, too.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
But he is gone.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Please, not on my account.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Is your husband with you?
Are you in the book?
I don't think I follow you.
I wasn't --
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Nothing. Good night.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Who is it?
Yes -- that's right.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Yeah? What's that?
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
I think it's funny.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
It's almost ten o'clock.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
You know her?
You were eavesdropping.
You found her?
What are you doing?
Hello?
Can you get inside?
No, you couldn't.
Why?
Pay no attention to me.
You gave me a 'D'.
What do you know about my father?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Mark Shale.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
No!
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
You heard about that?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
I'm making you feel like meat?
My dad's down there!
What are you doing?
Hi mom.
Mom?
Did he say anything else about her?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
On what side of the family?
What are you doing?
What?
You can have both if you want.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Unfair?!
Stacy?
help me get in the truck.
Where's Sam?
Where do you want this stuff?
Great.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
...moron.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog ain't mean.
Come on, get in the truck.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...


What?
Oh, shit.

...I'm not the psycho.
You wanna hit me?
I did not steal the truck.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Holy shit...
Come on, old...
Fuck!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
...do we?
Okay.

Get over!  Get over!
...Pete.  Come on.
Okay.  That didn't work.

Yeah...

Oh, no!


...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
...shit.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.



Oh.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
We!
Here...
And Brynner's right on...
...tunnel!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Oh.
Sorry.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
You.
Us.  Owes us.
Yeah.
...-tiatin'.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Be cool.  Be--
Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Well, that just about figures for today.
Yeah, that's my truck.
...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
...take my sorry old truck.
...here.   Mason...
...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.


Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.


Mm-hm.
"Went away."  I like that.
All right.  After they put you away...
I can't say it's a surprise.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...

All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.

Dennis!
What about these two?
Right.  Tim Mason.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
...gear?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Is this your establishment?
Assumptions are always...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
Hello.
...the river.
...-tainer!
...and unharmed, de-...



It's after five...
Rangers.
Hit it...
No sign of 'em...
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
Great.  All right...
...that tunnel.
Is Elvis out?
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...is a perfect hunter.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
Where are you now...
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Yeah, I'm sure.
Gimme this god-...

We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Look at that.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Always?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Just find the girl.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Of course I do. Where are you?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
That's just lovely.
The apple core?
Hello, Jake.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Or her name?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
My husband's at the office.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
I can't tell you.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
As little as possible.
Where are you going?
Okay, give me the keys.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
What does it look like?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Upstairs. Why?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Let me handle that.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
The obituary column?
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Never?
The water.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Come again?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Gittes.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He owned the water department?
What about?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
How's school?
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Yes. I want proof.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
My husband...you know him.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Who else you been to see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
What's the matter?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
I know that, Emily -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Toothache.
What's funny now?
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
You're very easily amused.
Where's the towel?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Would you sing for me?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm going to leave you.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
They do it only because you do!
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Why not?
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
What's this?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
How did you meet him?
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
She's plastered, isn't she?
Are you sure?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's not the same.
Excuse me, but...
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Yeah, but not in here.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Nobody! I swear!
You saw it?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Was I right?
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You're serious. You want to date again.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Well he asked me for it!
Are you open?
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
You don't want to know.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Great story, isn't it?
Allan Harris.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I'm talking to myself here.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Yeah.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
The quest isn't going well?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
The milkmaids.
Thirty-seven!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
At least we're stuck here together.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
What!?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
You hate people.
I can't close the store.
An embolism in a pool.
Shut the hell up.
No!
Who found him?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Her fucking body fell out!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
May I be blunt with you?
I like to expand my horizons.
Holy shit. That girl?
Then how come you got the fine?
You're happy?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
You're a snake.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
How's your eye?
You didn't have to choke me.
How do you figure?
It's not like I'm miles away.
He's got those love handles.
Oh for God's sake!
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
What's that mean?
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
You used to go out with her?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
You calling me a liar?
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
You're kidding.
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
How much money did you leave up there?
You're trusting.
Ooh! Can we?!
How flattering.
How many girls have you slept with?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
HOW MANY?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Hey! Where are you going?!
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Feel that.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
You hope what feels good?
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I... I don't know what to say.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
A monkey?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
What the hell are you doing here?!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
What are we going to do?
Two...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
You can stop right there.
Where've you been?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I don't understand?
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Gabe...your arm?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Take the rope.
Take the rope.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
What about you?!
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You said there was a way across.
What's your names?
Then where the fuck is!
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Where's the third one, Travers?
This way.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Hullo.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Do you still feel suicidal?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Surprise?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Crime?
Yes sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Good. What do you want?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Fucking hell...
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Moloko-plus.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Go ahead, say it.
You like Bach?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Annie...it's Max.
Max, the cab driver!
...he's two floors below you.
Remember what you played?
You know Dmitri?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
What are you gonna do?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm standing right here.
You're kidding me.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
How long you think this'll take?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
I think he's dead.
You - you killed him?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Are you breathing?
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Vincent?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Gimme your wallet.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
In case he asks.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
They said send you downstairs.
That's love.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Saved you last night's, too.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Just relax.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
So why are they after you?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You okay?
You want something to drink?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Who are you, Jerry?
So what's the question?
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
What is it?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I'm sorry.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
A dog.
I'm still listening.
Where'd you get it?
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Agent Lowry.
Jonas?
Can I talk to you a second?
I want to believe you, too.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What?
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
There's no plug to pull.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway --
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Peter sends his regards.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
You know why I'm here.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
What?
And?
Dr. Cullers?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Could we hear God?
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So who...?
So we passed some kind of test?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
No more stalling, Captain.
It's time to go home now.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
And in return?
What's that?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Hokkaido Island.
Ellie.  Arroway.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
That you, Valerian?
Ellie -- are you okay?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
I flinched.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
Ellie --
How do you mean?
So.  The final countdown.
But --
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
How'd you find me?
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Tell us about it.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here's the Patrol.
Here, Captain.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Oh Lord!
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
I'm in.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
One, two, three...
He'll never make it.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
You bastard!
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Because of your phone calls.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
We've got another one.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Ruben.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
What's that siren?
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
Maybe you should...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
Are you always so bold?
They all have one...
He was in my apartment!
Just get out of your vehicle...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
It's none of my business anymore...
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
What's wrong with him?
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
What's Abba?
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
How about I put Nikko on it?
Sergeant?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Detective Niccoletti?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Where's the car?
What!? They brought the car here?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
You haven't told me where we're going.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
Please finish your story.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
How?
What do you think of this one?
What's all the dreck?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
What do you think?
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Yes.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
But you're checking it out.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
He asked me to marry him.
For a price.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I have a terrible confession.
Then it's over.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Just checking.
Yeah.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Hey.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Promise?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Something like that.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
Can I put these here for tonight?
You don't have a fever.
But what about that math project?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
No.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
All tapped out.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
A pass.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Zero.   That's all I know.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Hello?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
And?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And for my help I would get what?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Tonight?
What kind of business?
Because you're the closest.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
He said to go fuck yourself.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We still have to get out of here.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
Hadley --
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Hello?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Does it really matter what I say?
I will.
Guns.   Can you get them?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
A thousand dollars?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Maybe you should call the police.
They were all French guys.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What hotel?
What room number?
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
Mr. Zammito?
Yeah.
No shit?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
How are we going to do that?
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I think we went the wrong way.
The money isn't here.
You're not helping.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Can't sleep?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
What's this?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Go ahead.
And if I use them to kill you?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Put them down.
I'm tired now.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You say she killed a policeman?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Never!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
You shouldn't have come.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Don't send me back!
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
What was it?
She needs direction... and training.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
It's Jade Fox!
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
I don't know...
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
And you're gonna tell me who.
What in the hell... do you call that?
You buying?
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
You're welcome.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
It's just the dope, don't worry
You look like a rock star without a job.
Mister Funboy.
Do you feel okay.
What's going on...?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
That thing is poisonous.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
I've got him if you want him.
An unexpected pleasure.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I'm Kathryn.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
So what year are you going into?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
At this hour? I don't think so.
How's the water?
I never said that.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
That's repulsive.
And you promise to abide by it?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Somerset Maugham.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Lighten up.
You really want to know?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
You don't know how to love.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Who is it?
Why didn't you do something?
He made you give him a blow job.
Excellent.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Where are you going?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Yes.
Is she with you?
Pleased to meet you.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Why not?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
I'll think about it...
Call me later.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Moving along quite well.
Who are you calling?
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Exactly the opposite.
Tell me all the details.
No, tell me.
It clearly is why.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Ronald?
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
She's not here.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Did she show up?
What song, dear?
Mommy --
But where did you get it, Amy?
Oh, thank you, darling.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You're shouting at me.
Where did you get it?
Hello, Amy.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Amy, not that old tree!
What do you want. Amy?
Why didn't you run after them?
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
These are all from me.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
What'd you get for Christmas?
But where is that?
I shall want you for always.
You'll always play with me?
But you must!
That's right!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Merry Christmas.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
It's a pretty ring.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But I only came to give back the ring.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
Mommy read it to ne.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Mother! You called me by name!
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Waiter! She needs more water.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
No.
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Jennifer?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Can't you get contacts?
Or if there's a full moon.
Where are all the mediums?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
What did he say?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
You expecting someone?
I think I just got my period.
You're such a good friend.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Fall in love.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
About Benito.
I wish I only had your problems.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
You hungry?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
What?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Coffee and...
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
When's the last time you saw him?
You busted me.
You wanna get some coffee?
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
Like what?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
I really gotta get going.
What's wrong?
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
What's with the squirt guns?
Your breasts feel larger.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
No, it was our first date.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
How long have you been here?
His wife.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
What is this place?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Lost something?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Who is it?
Why give yourself up?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Don't say a .
Is this dangerous or anything?
They barely talk anymore.
I'm not certain about...
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Oh... I'm fired?
Fine?
Just don't call him, Alan!
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
What's with the cameras?
What I told him to?
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
They could put you in jail.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
At a press conference.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
You ever think back to how you started.
Your government needs your help.
Really?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
What's that?
You're kidding.
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
That was quite a thing you did today.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
That's a secret.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
I never thought I'd...
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
The Monroe?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're all set,  sir.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
You what?!  How did you do that?
So, uh, where are you in school?
Hello?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Well, sure!
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Chris!
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Uh-huh.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Again!  Louder!
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
You really think I should forget her?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
Want to come to the study group?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Neil, you're not gonna...
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
How do we get out of here?
Who are you?
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Where are my men?
Hanover, listen...
Who gives a shit about aft?
Maybe we lost them.
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
What are those things?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Self sufficient...
What is it?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
I think he knows that Joey.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey...it's okay...
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Man, don't go up there...
What was that?
Check it out!
Fucking women, man...
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
What the --!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Whee-uu!
You're back.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
You like to call me Linda now?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Where's it gone?
No?
Not so good.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
You Biederman?
Linda...
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Okay.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
How's the trailer?
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
That way it sets.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Promise! You gotta promise!
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, hoping?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets.
No way. No fucking way!
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
No.
That's it. No. No way.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
You didn't get a deer?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Cynthia! Sure.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Up I would say... What would you say?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Mug sheets.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
I'm wasting time.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Kill him... kill him.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Sir, your limo's here.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
You my partner?
Are you a cop?
Does it drive itself, too?
I'll inform dispatch.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Can I ask you something?
How then?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Married?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
I just heard.
You never want to find out.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
I'll take it.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
You're lying.
She couldn't be gone!
Never mind. What's your name?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire!
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
What -- what's on your mind?
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Why of course --
Dan'l Webster?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
How much?
Jabez -- help!
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Your butter money?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Mary -- what would you do?
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Why don't they come --
Jabez -- Jabez!
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
Do you really think that?
I want you to fix these fish!
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
What's that?
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
You mean -- a jury trial?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
I want someone to talk to ...
I can't be honest with them.
I'm John McClane.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
One of yours?
What's happening?
The police...?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
The code key, please...?
Bad for your health anyway.
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
What are you doing?
They would, huh?
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
What's going on?
Is that him?
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
How are you doing?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
What are you talking about?
I don't know what I'm doing.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah... yeah.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
What kind of things, Leon?
Yeah.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Sonny, be reasonable!
The girl hostages.
Don't fuck with me ...
Okay, is the vault open?
The gun's right on your back...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
You got kids?
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
What?
You got Bank Americard?
Did you always call him Junior.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
We won't have to.
He wants one.
To show that we're negotiating.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...

You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Hey, let's get ready!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Oh my God, mother!
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
You're news, Sonny ...
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.

This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Fast and or furious.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
How you be?
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
Yo!
I'm gonna leave now.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
Make it plain.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Good morning.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.

Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Mookie?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
Why you gotta curse?
It's cold.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Smack him back.
I didn't know you could read.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
I'll do that.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
I know this.
I'm listening.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
How do you know this?
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Turn it off.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Oh my god, are you alright?
But I came here to learn about America.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Excuse me.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
O'clock?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Would you like something to drink?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Just down the hall.
Okay.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
The name's Walter.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
I haven't seen you around here before.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Where did you learn that word?
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
I didn't know that.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
What?
Who's your partner?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
That's a cow, Harry.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
You have beautiful eyes.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
A raft.
You certainly did.
It's okay. I want the rush.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Well, I'm listening now.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Guys, this is much better.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
TURK, leave him alone.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Yes, what?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Well, something stinks.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Have you got what I want?
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
Left here! Left!
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
It's a surprise.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
What's that you're saying?
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
So, this is Leto the Just...
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
As the legend says.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Always?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
We call that one Muad'dib.
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Did they try and fail?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Bela, what happened?!
What's in the needle?
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
And, cut...
Last night was quite a romp.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
H-how'd you know?!
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
It takes me comfortable.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
I kinda need it now.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I like to think so.
I think you're quite handsome.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
OUR picture?
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Did you find it boring?
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
I can't get it to go up.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
I'm really sorry...
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
You know, to make the legs move --
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
How's your mother?
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You know what would be great?
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
How you doing, Ed?
Yeah?
Ed --
I don't think so.

Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
No. It's a mess.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
She could've been a nurse.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
Hi, Mom.
What is she, at work?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
I can't?
How much less?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Why do it?
Go!
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
I wish my stepfather was here.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So...?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
You would do this? You would actually --
I'm doing all right.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
... Ray?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Look, we gotta talk.
No -- keep it.
No. Two times.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Hi.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Can I help with anything?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
By the X.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Yo --
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
What d'you got?
Mostly Tammy fans
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Tracy.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
NO, that's fine
Thanks for everything.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
I guess you know why you're here
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Yes?
So what brings you here?
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
And when did you do it?
And how did you get in the school?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Could you get this? I can't
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Yeah.  I'm here.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
And she's super-nice
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
I mean at you.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Can I sign yours too?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Tell me about Patchett.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
<u>What do you want</u>?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
You know him?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
That's him.  That's him.
Where are we going?
Why?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
More or less.
Anything?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
I... No.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
<u>No</u>.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Glasses.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
What's on the call sheet?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
Lynn Bracken.
You sound like you mean it.
I'll take your word for it.
On what evidence?
Not a word.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Um...who's that?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know what that--
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
What do you think?
That is one ugly sunrise.
They're here.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
What if <u>what</u>?
How?
Feeling lucky?
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
That's fine.
Very good.
I know, but--
That's my point.
Yes?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Your stuff?
About the accident.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
Anything at all?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
You should take this seriously.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
What?
I'm sorry.
Who did you work with to get the--
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
Oh, please--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I know.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Does that hurt?
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
What can I do for you?
You don't know who the fuck--
Actually, that's not true.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
It is fish.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
This conversation's over.
Yeah?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
He didn't.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Gentlemen--
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
I don't under--
Robert--
She can't talk to you right now.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Sure, go ahead.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No, but they took my blender.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I don't know. I mean--
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Turn yourself in.
Yeah?
You think there was a connection to--
What's your opinion?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
What about the tapes?
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Thank you.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
You felt obliged to.
Actually, you sing.
Shall we be all right?
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Do they know them?
When were you least happy?
What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
I can still taste you.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
If I could just see some identification.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Which we've overflown twice.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Why do they care about our maps?
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still
May God make safety your companion.
How are you?
David Caravaggio.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Or was it Toronto?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Well, then ask him his name!
Buon' giorno.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
I can see my wife in that view.
Excuse me -
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
Why Picton?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
Pardon me?
Whoa - give me a chance!
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Certainly not.
Katharine!
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
This is wonderful!
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
The windows don't open.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
And the draft blew over the flowers.
You don't call, you don't write.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
Seems I am.
I didn't expect you to be so...
I've got something for you.
For God's sake.
But Roki said--
Very nice.
Motorcycle.
You stole my luggage? You--
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
You're late.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Let's do it again.
That's it. We're ready.
I trust it's your size.
You bought this for me?
Thank you.
To us. To the Mask.
You're nervous again.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
They moved it.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
What?
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
What about the rules?
Got it.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
That's because you grew up rich.
Not for me.
Come on.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
He looks familiar.
In the van.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You two make quite a couple.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Tonight your league night?
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
There's more than one?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
This is a real nice place you got here.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
I don't even know how much money that is.
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
All I have is hundreds.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
What medical records?
This is the only thing you found?
I don't get why they'd do that.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
I like this case.
I want my fucking money --
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
Is that what you want?
What kind of things come up?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Fuck Kurt.
I was wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Ross.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
PG& -- Are you sure?
She's one of the sick people?
Hey -- those are my files --
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
You want my number?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What are you doing here?
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
That's Ed.
They up?
Where's my paycheck?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Wow, that's soon --
Dr. Paulsen?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Who's Baxter?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Yes, My Lord.
My lord.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
He can do it.
He'll learn.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
I can't ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks a doleful farewell.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... the power?
Yeah ...
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
I think we're in trouble.
Yes, Your Highness?
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
I don't like this.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
How's your mining operation going?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Get out of here, Lando!
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
We've got to find Luke.
What?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Jabba the Hutt?
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Ben?  Ben?
Will they die?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Yes, My Lord.
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
Humans?
His reactor's starting to overheat.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Who's that?
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Give it to me.
I thought he was, but he came back.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Shut up, Plissken.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Not you?
Plissken...?
Getting ready to invade.
I said pull over.
Where is it?
How do you know all this?
Me too?
What're you doing in here?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
What are they?
How do we get out of here?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Is he coming?
When you threw it in, what did you see?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Whose son am I?
You saved me from the arrow...
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Excalibur! Is it true?
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I left it in the tent, sir.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
Why?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
A lovestruck page!
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What honey?
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
It's-
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
And you got an invitation.
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Excuse me Miss?
How are you today?
A stimulant.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
We still think the temporal lobe...
Are you sure?
Chris MacNeil?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Where?
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
I didn't get you?
Wanna drink.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Yes. He's already here.
Oh look at that.
You've been playing with it?
Who's Captain Howdy?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
I don't want it.
All done.
Karras.
Where'd you get it then?
Think you can sleep?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
Do it again.
What's that?
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Dimmy, you worry for something?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
What is it?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Who?
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
...Be gone!!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys!
Twelve years.
What's our friend's problem?
What's wrong with them?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
What do you do to him?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
What do you think?
Seeing anyone in particular?
Your older brother.
What's with Charlie?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
What're you talking about?
So you'll come out, right?
Nice, huh?
A gust of wind killed him.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
Jack.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
You hit me.
See anything?
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
You all right?
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
All night?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Really.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
You saw wrong.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
We're not getting paid then.
Nothing. We get nothing.
You don't know?
Jack, you're on television.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
What?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Uh... he knows it.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
This where the auditions are?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
When?
Ready?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
What I mean is --
What-?
Come on.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine!
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Virgins?
I don't believe it.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Uh ...
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
I can't sing it anymore.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Brought it.
No.
Don't worry about it.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
No.
It went well tonight.
Is that the way it is?
You never sang before?
Fucking.
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Aren't the kids asleep?
So why's he do it?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
How do you do it? Every night?
All I said was you were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Frank said ---
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Yeah.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Guess they're up.
How do you know?
Older than me.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
So. How are you?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Fine work, Jon.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Where am I?
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
That's not the worst part.
... I was dreaming ...
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
I took it from my fake husband.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Now what?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Castor's escaped!
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You have kids, Jack?
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Excuse me?
Rise...and...shine...!
Were almost done here...
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
Yes you do...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Ive got kids, Im going home...
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
I have a bad feeling about this.
I can't seem to let go of you...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Shes your dog, Jack.
Hello!
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Thanks, Jack...
No?
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Our life in a nutshell...
How was the game, honey?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Thank you...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Not it...?
Jack.
Jack...can we afford all this?
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Youre so...beautiful...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
Dont do that...
You look great.
Whats going on?
Youre moving...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Youre not married, are you?
Mrs. Peterson.
No...
I need you, tiger..
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I want to see you again.
Thats totally see through...
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
What about his first born?
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
How long was I out?
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
What's wrong with me?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
Ben?
About me?  How sweet.
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
What are you doing --
How's the IPO?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
But I'm not done with the machine --
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
What?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
What are you doing?
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
What is it?
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
How bad off is he?
-- and why we need you.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
Trip? Where to?
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Just one, General...
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Listen...the Heart.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
He's making a fine recovery.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
Thank you for saving my life.
What do you mean?
But that isn't possible.
We can't take a second more.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
It's against my better Judgment...
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
What happened?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
...Is this a fucking joke?
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Yah, he -
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
but do you know that for sure without -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Well... yah.
Yah!
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
...Is everything okay?
How ya doin', Wade?
No kiddin'?
Stan and I're okay.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
No, see -
How's it look, Marge?
Yah.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
...Geez.
Yah, that's a good one.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah - how are you doon?
Better times.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Nope.
Nope.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Hello?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
And this guy is...
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Copy.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Yah, I guess.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
I'm tellin' ya.
The first rule of Project --
What... ?
You are a moron.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
It means it was homemade.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
We need to talk.
Why are you doing this?
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
You're kidding.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
How did you find me?
This could go on for hours.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
I think everything's okay here.
Is this a trick?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is that what you're calling it?
You got about thirty seconds.
What?
Let go of me!
Why are you doing this?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Tyler?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
What do you do, Tyler?
Insurance'll cover it.
Well, I have to file a claim...
I don't follow...
Huh?
Would that be a problem?
What?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
The fight.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
Okay... Ghandi.
You get rid of her.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Something on your mind?
I want to hear the truth.
"Too young?"
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Defuse the bomb?
Can't you call it off... ?
Please...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why... why... why... ?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
But, this is Project Mayhem.
Ain't that something?
I... I don't know...
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
What list?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
What did you see?
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
I'm not sure I understand.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
May we come in?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
What is it?  What are you?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Mom?
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Is that something you're "feeling?"
This place?!
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Stop the car!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Knock it off!
Get control of yourself!
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Ever do this from a jet?
Again.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
You read me, Brewer?
You okay?
What's this?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
What's this stuff on the rice?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
How you doing, Brewer?
Roundeye.
That guy's not going to make it.
You better take off.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Why'd they want us?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
What was that?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
That's an order.
You think they'll find any?
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
Who're you?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
What do you think?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
No.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Remember. One chorus and out.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
How un-sixties of you.
Yes.
A list.
Free?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Where am I?
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They said you're The One.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
Him...?
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Do you follow her every day?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
.....What are you doing?
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
In a bar called Hellfire.
Parry Parry?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
How do you know him?
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
Excuse me...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Okay, Ray...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Rayette.
Come on.
What's your name?
How far are you going to?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No. We have tomatoes.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Robert Eroica...
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Maybe you better stay, then.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
Like what?
Swimming?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
If you're free.
Wait...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Well...
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
Pardon me?
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
What?
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
Wussup?
Remember me, from the pool?
So watcha doin'?
That's it?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Wha'?
So what girls are over there?
I gotta go take a piss.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
I think by Twenty-two.
Yo! What you goin' for
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
What she look like?
My friend told me she lived around here.
So what do you want with her anyway?
How do I know you're not lying.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Hey!
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
Hey you're really nuts.
You're lucky.
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
You can't keep me here.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
What the hell are you doing here?
So where do you know Alan from?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Mrs. Smith.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
No idea at all?
The two surfer boys?
You find the source?
Here you are, Doctor.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Ten days ago?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I'm the Sufi.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Because we can't.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Do you have a passport?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
'Magic' today, huh?
Shoot.
Did you hear something?
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Why do you keep doing this?
You ordered it here?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Lunch...
Good point.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
You can't do that.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
I would, actually.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Fletch.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
Gummy and two cops...
I have some ideas.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
I was upset.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Now that we've broken the ice...
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Did she tell you anything?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
That was close...
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
All your friends call you Jazz.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
How'd you get this from her?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I don't know, what was the case?
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Hey, they blew me.
It's red, Ford.
My axe!
This is boring, guys.
Ford, you were right!
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
I can't kill this kid's father...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Who cares?  I got a case.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
The point?
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Shit.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
That's cute.  You're funny.
This isn't music!
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Where are you?
Well try, okay?
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
What?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
It's your problem.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Are you sure it is dead?
Sale boulot.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
It's beautiful.
You're in show business.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
I got no music!
Des Moines.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
When ya go back on?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Who is that guy?
No, you?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
You got the warrant?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
It was a crematorium.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Yeah.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
How about a little of the King?
How was your tour?
You give him his drops?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
I swear, Satch.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What the hell...
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
What are you talking about?
What?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
When?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Dad...?
Yeah, it's me.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Whatta we do now?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
What are we like in...1998?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How you feeling?
John.  John, you all right?
You're not looking too good.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
I look familiar?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
No kiddin'?
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
No more... I can't!
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Which one is it?
A hammock?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
This is too painful to look at.
Is... is everything all right?
I don't see anything.
What're you doing?
Bullseye!
Why do you do these stupid things?!
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Darren, we better turn around.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Oh, jeez.
Is that all you found?
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
...And I said, shut up!
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
What?
So what are ya drawin'?
Lake Forest Green?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
So where's Cort gone off to?
He didn't say anything?
What's goin' on?
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
You need to leave.
Ed...
What's the problem here?
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
Wanna know how I did that?
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
That was truly excellent.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
Jason's here in New York.
What are you doing in here?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
What did you do with Rennie??
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
So, are you having fun yet?
I heard you weren't coming.
What about you?
But Rennie...
Crosstown.
Say it again.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
It's just a review.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
How do you Eknow.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
What are we talking about?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What will we talk about?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
Your father said you might be here.
I'll have whatever she's having.
Opening night, Lillian.
Alma Wetzel.
Life is good.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
A thousand things.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
They're my team.
Yes, Peter.
Yes.
This could be it.
There was a review.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Would you like to meet him?
He wears a disguise.
But you're his friend.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
It is the work of untouchables.
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
You mean a general strike?
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
All right. Fine.
Have you read his magazine?
You almost sound like you believe that.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Surely you know what you have.
At least it's nothing contagious.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
Call German.
How was your evening?
Where are we going?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How the hell did you get here.
Where are you going?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
What do you think?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Hugo!  I've found him!
No bother.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why don't we say we were together?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
I envy you, Jerome.
Who are they?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
The doctor will give you something.
What about them?
That's your problem.
What do you add up to here?
We'll try again.
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Boring.
I guess I'm kind of...
Wait... give me a minute.
How was it?
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Yeah.
Do you mean that?
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Only one car.
How much?
We better stick here till tonight.
We got this far.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What is it?
You okay?
Are we going to make it?
What now?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
All right. Shells?
Then you do it.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
That's what I want.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
You can trust him...
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What did you do?  Albert?
Oh ay?
I made a mistake.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Address?
What about?
Really.
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
We went about together.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Now tell me the truth.
Oh, what you doing now?
You coming to South America?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Where would I find him?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
See you later.
What happened to you, then?
I'll call the police.
You sod.
What'll they do to him?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What you going to do?
Do you want breakfast?
What's it to you anyway?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Not suede boots!
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
...this shit...
...that's right...
For some sales pro...
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
You didn't?
Is that what I said?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
In the abstract...
I can't close 'em.
It is dead.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Were the leads...
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
They're inured to it.
Will you excuse us please?
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Excuse me, fella.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Would you come in here, please?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
...you talk to Murray...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Yes.
...ah, fuck this...
I'm out.
Why?
Of what?
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
I wish I could.
What happened?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Yes.  I hear you.
Mmm.
Why I don't...
How do you know I made it up?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
You robbed the office.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
It was his idea.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Why?
Shit.
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
When?
Fuck you care...?
Fuck her...
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Glad to meet you.
I wanted to speak with you about...
My wife told me to look into...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Rick...
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Yes.
What was yesterday?
What?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
We haven't got a lead...
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Have a good trip.
Listen to me: They got some of them.
It went down.  I filed it.
We had a slight burglary last night.
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
What if we don't pay?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Yes, thank you.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Ready, Frankie.
Oh, 'scuse me.
I never met them.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
You're going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
What was it, so I'll know.
I asked about Fredo?
Was it a boy or a girl?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
I want it met.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
I'm going to the market.
Kay.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Where?
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
There are still things I have to do.
Not good.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
I know.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
I want you to settle on their terms.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
On the phone?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What if I say shove it?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
I accept your generosity...
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
I wasn't going to try anything.
Sure.  I loved it.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
You ever been married, Hanna?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Then you're as single as I am.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
And your name is --?
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
These are your paintings?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You went to university?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Do you mind?
I liked it.  We all did.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
So you had a wife?
I never thought you were.
So we understand each other?
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Why not?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
No.  The girl.
Is that really her?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Let's get out of this funk hole
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Is that --?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
So it is going to happen after all.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
You okay?
You coming, Boone?
Where's Betty?
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
What are you doing here?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
Jimmy.  How are you?
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
This is the studio where I paint.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
You're serious.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
Can that count as one question?
I was going to take a swim.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
How's the leg?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
It seems she neglected to mention it
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Yeah -- ?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Well, that certainly won't do.
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You have my word...
When'd you get to town, Raines?
It just ain't happening --
okay ...
Diane 1.
Yeah.
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
What about him?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What color?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
How are we supposed to--
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
Have you seen him?
Why didn't you tell me?
He's in some trouble ...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
I know...
We'll take it...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Kip -- ?
You all right -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
I heard you were pumping gas -
"About what?"
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
You?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Dad'd be proud --
What era was that -- ?
What are you doing here?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
What kind of trouble -- ?
I go with you --
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Where to -- ?
What -- ?
You remember Junie?
Okay, then... Otto?
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
What do you want, shithead?
What are you doing here, assface?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
You want the melon?
I better call again.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
You know what to do?
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Who'd you call?
It's a way outta here.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Okay.
How'd you know where to find me?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Is that true?
Did she get my Double Burger?
Holy shit.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Chuck, let's go.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
I don't think I...Larry?
How'd you like that course?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
And what do you see?
Where is it touching you?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
No, there's a limit.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
--That edge!
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Will.
Yes.
So who won the bet?
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
You're here quite a bit, then.
Seems like it's going well.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
He married his cousin.
Oh, that's nice--
Hello, Sean.
So I hear you're taking some time.
Well, she out did herself today...
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're getting defensive, Will.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
That must have taken you a long time.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
No.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
Why not?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
My wife's dead.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
When did you know she was the one?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Yes.
The wrench, why?
I know.
That's what you want?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
I really don't 'date' that much.
I bet you have a great family.
Yeah.
I swear to God.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I've never seen your place.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I want you to come with me.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Ready, Ma?
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Maybe the road's out.
I didn't see nothin'.
So long.
That's not your affair. Name.
Two and a half cents.
Deputy sheriffs.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
That cut you got?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
What's the matter?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
But we can still do it, honey.
Lookin' for a job?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I stay in my own yard.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
Got any plants?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Know where we're a-goin'?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Mad, Ma?
How about it, Ma?
Yes'm, that was it.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Ma, you sick?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
How's it feel, Tommy?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Yeah?
Tommy?
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
How you get all this money?
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Now you done it! You busted it!
You don't...
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Bob...
Never better.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Yes.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
There you go. I left it blank.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Well?
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
I have scruples. Next.
This is not good.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
No, I don't have one.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
God it's great to see you.
He sells BMW's?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I have to get my head back into my work.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How are you? How's business?
Why not?
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
You lived in Chicago?
He's beautiful.
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Poor thing.
Son?
How did you meet her?
Ever think of moving there full time?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Why don't you go lie down?
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
What?
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
How long is this going to go on?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did you ask him to come visit?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
When? Tonight?
Who's going to want me now?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
What about Grace?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
What did he say?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
What if she doesn't want to go?
And you think it's best if I don't come.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
What choice!!?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Of course not.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
I don't believe it.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
She gonna be long?
What does she do?
Mmm. An editor.
Are you afraid of anything?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
What, sweetheart?
You shut up, stupid!
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Welcome to our show!
What's that?
Shit!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Snoop onto them...
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Oh, shit! He got me.
Yes!
We need your help.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
What?
Alright, so what have we got?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Oh, wow, she's great.
Uhhhmm...
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
There's a new virus in the database.
Colonel who?
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
What number please?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Who's that?
Brady!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
What?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Had enough?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Hi Rachel.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
This is starting to spook me.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
How's it powered?
Sort of.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Jamie! Get away!
What?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
You still spooked?
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Yes, you can.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Yeah, sure.
You have the wrong feeling.
TOTALLY!
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Okay. Later.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
There WAS.
Right.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Are you sure?
Hello.
Thorazin.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I see.
What did he say?
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
...any sister talk?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Yeah.
I know.  It's terrible!
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Uh...
You're joking.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
Hmm?
I can't resist.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
You're Holly.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Yes, but you name names.
No!  No...
Page a hundred and twelve.
Oh, you-you have that one?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Elliot!  Don't!
Oh!
Elliot!
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
Lee...
You bet.
Are you in a bad mood?
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Hi.  How's she doing?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Oh, Mom!
Want some coffee or tea?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
...or films you must see or...
What's the problem?
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Look at this guy.
Oh, Jesus!
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Yes!
Oh, yeah?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
That's really nice!
Mh-hm.
Isn't that great?
Gee.
This is the second opinion.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Perfect!
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Oh, Hannah!
Ouch!
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Oh, God...
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
You treat me like a loser.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Good.
Hey, what's the matter?
My script?
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
So how are you?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
It's all right.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Mickey?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
...<u>please</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Well.  Word gets around.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
...very good.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
...are they hard to get?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Where was the call from.
He escaped...
I like Popcorn...
Now, why in the world would he do that?
And how would you know that?
...here's to child abuse!
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
A fellow with five fingers.
No.
I know you did what you could.
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Waal...
Give it up.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
My scar is a war-wound.
Yes.  How did you know?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Yes.... yes...
And you let her get away.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
...which of us is free...?
...might I make a suggestion...?
...when I...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
You should get Married.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...what?
No.
Don't shoot yourself.
Ask me when we get home.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Yes.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
You think you're so...but you're just...
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Now what? What did I do this time?
There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Mine!
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
That would be a No.
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
What in the hell did you do that for?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
God, you're beautiful.
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Don't say that.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Oh, I have to hear this.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
All right.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Things are going to change, Earl.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
What do you want from me?
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
What are you doing?
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
No way, no day!
Probably....
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
And your worst enemy.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
Perrier water!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Answer him dick!
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
You two....
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
What does old Stew want?
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
What?
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Since what?
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Yeah? You and who else?
Hello I'm Dr...
Who's Allison?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
That was cold...
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Hey buddy!
What do you want?!
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Last week...
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Here.  Get off here.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
That too.
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Ticket!  What's going on?
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
I didn't ask him.
Was that your dad?
And the rent is okay?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
I should.
Right.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, great.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Do you have a family?
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
What happened?
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Baby, what is it?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Honey --
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
And it's a shorter commute.
How were we -- were we cool?
Do you remember who gave us this?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
I think it's time I came home now.
What?
God, your sister's really hot.
Lieutenant?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
Tough.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Detective Bedsoe.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
The river.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Thank you, Thomas.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
This cannot be.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Your life.
Sometimes.
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
Where did you get it?
You're hurt.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
No.
Yes.
Is it?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
He's in there!
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
We found him this morning.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
What'd you find out?
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
I have to tell you something --
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
We're cool.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I'll give you these people.
Let me come get him.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Are you out of your mind?
What do you want?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
No one's coming.
Kevin left without you.
You gotta pee?
What do you want?
What's going on?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Chief, Mikkelson.
It's mine.  Talley.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
What are you people going to do?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Where are you right now?
He has lots of disks.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Are the disks still in your room?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
What is this about?
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
Will you protect us.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
Where are my supplies?
You know what the Scottish call it?
I committed no war crimes.
I led no massacres.
Lets go, Jock.
Great, I really need a shower.
There are no more rooms.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Who did you call?
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Oh, my God!
Has Roger spoken yet?
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
I have a confession. When we met...
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
What are you doing?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff and guests! How many?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
Not yet.
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Jesus H. Christ!
More the merrier.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
I'm sorry --
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Oh, Jesus....
-- closed.
Is she...alright?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
What?
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
What are you talking about?
I was in the middle of --
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
I was upstairs!
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Well, I don't.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Oh, no.
Won't do any good.
Pritchett: what is going on?
Please.....anyone....help me?
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
By freeing them.
It's going to hurt us!
She's down...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
She says she's lonely...
Help me!  Please!!!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Mommy!
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
Are you playing tricks on me?
What the hell is that?
The heater's here.
No.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Who?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
How are we doing?
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
We don't know.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
We'll never know for sure.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Why are you so interested?
What?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Every day.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Joey ... ?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
What ... What ... ?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Yes. 53
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
That was beautiful.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Alex, are you....
How.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
I was the Warden?
Catholic girls are scary...
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
No, let me!
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Remember that shoe you lost...
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
This is the worst night...
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Why does this have to be so hard...
Something short.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Hungry, anyway.
Cigarette?
You're from Muncie?!
Well, I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Smitty.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...The people look like ants.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Oh, Norville --
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
Just got hired today!
Ya know, entry level!
How long've you been down here?
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
My pleasure, sir.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
...You don't?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
...education, were you?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
But --
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
I got gas, Bennie.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
Hello, Niagara.
...adenoids.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
What's this?
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
Does she suffer?
She can never be cured?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
But it's so far away...
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
But don't you have to work?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
I wish I hadn't heard --
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
It is not beautiful.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
Well?
I told you.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
Wesley!
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
I don't know -- I don't know--
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
You're staring at me.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Good night.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
The turkey in?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Yeah, that one.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
That this was going to be a key party?
Ready to go?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Hi dad.
So how's school treating you?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
About?
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
A prior engagement overcame me.
Dad stop it!
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Who?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
I suppose. Why?
Please don't.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
How'd you know?
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Forget what?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Huh?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Yeah.
I do.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
How do you know this shit?
I don't ever want to see you.
When worlds collide.
You get in trouble?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
I don't know. How do I know?
Nice kid.
You did your homework, Officer.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Do it again.
This murder was in the papers, right?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What are you doing here?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
So?
What do you want to talk about?
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Fred Duggar?
Will.
I don't know.
I was her best friend.
I don't know.
She used some stupid code name.
Down at the station?
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
You're not following procedure.
Monstrous.
Your lips, they didn't move.
That is a picture, nothing more.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
Then blame the one who made her...
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Are these not the answers you came for?
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
But you're the fairest by far.
And if I cut my hair again?
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Laudanum!
I want more.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
This is no performance.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
He can protect us, Claudia.
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You've just done it -
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Did I hear a yes?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Dear God, what have I done?
Have you ever been caught?
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
Where are we?
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
I didn't want to kill her.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
And they frighten you?
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Did he die in the fire?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
What can I do for you?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
He does work hard.
I'm the King of the World.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Nice move.
Never do that again.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Voodoo.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
You sure it's okay with you?
Julie? What's wrong?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
There was a body! I swear it!
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
What's the matter, boy trouble?
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
Where is everybody?
Where'd Estes go?
He is exhausted.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Goodbye.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
You're just talking nonsense.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
I have forgotten it, dear.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
What would I be thinking?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
What is her illness?
You know that sound, Oliver?
It makes me fear her.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
Thea, what's wrong?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Get that ladder up here.
George . . .
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
You have no car.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Poor George . . . Sit down.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Hey, who's that?
Who is it?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Hey, Ernie!
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Today, over at the house.
There it is, good as new.
Hee-haw!
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
What's that?
She's swell.
Hmmmm . . .
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Oh . . .
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
What gives?
I know, but . . .
Violet Bick!
Well, what do you know  wife.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Now look, did you buy anything?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Yes, sir.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
With coconuts?
Well, hello.
Me?
If I told you it might not come true.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
When did you get back?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Where's your coat and hat?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Where're you going?
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
It's okay, it's okay....
Get on the rocks!
No.
Why not?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
But the island!
Throw it.
Coming up!
You coming up on him?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
What is it?  What's there?
We got a helluva tide this month.
I know just where to go.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Untie that rope.
You're too close.  Back off.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Pop....
Michael.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
There is nothing to discuss.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Where the hell were you?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
One what?  Ah-ha!
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
What?
What're you doing?
Are you serious?
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Yeah?  Then what?
Some people.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
I told you, remember?
What's wrong?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
You're not going out right away, are you?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Terry!  You okay?
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Anyone know what time it is?
The wind drift is lateral.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
What's the lighthouse?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
It'll be fun, come on!
I don't care.
He's got to help or it won't work.
Who wouldn't.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Michael....
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Go on, Doctor.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Well, not much longer to go.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
My imagination isn't that good.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Where's the rubber band?
What do I do now?
Where are you going?
And leave me down here???
You all right?
How the hell did it get in here?
Here.
Yes.  It's faster.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
How is he?
That's right.
I am.  You're not.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Not at all.
Some miss all their shots.
That's because I am the shark.
Believe me, I am.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
I think they'll come out now.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Hi, Mike.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
So, you just get here?
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
'Course they're also so rich.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
You were great out there!
Besides that.
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
Isn't this fun!
Take it up.
What're you doing later?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Did you see that?
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Make sure you put this back.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
The world's southern most reaches.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
How'd you do in school?
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
Turn it off....
Sweetheart....
Where is she?
It'll grow on you.
Beginning of what?
Michael!  This thing working?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Stop that....
That....
That hurt....
Are you all right?
A big one....
I'll be in to read you a story.
I want you to get out of the water....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
I didn't mean to start that....
You could teach...You could....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You look tired....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Can you just go off...?
It was no accident....
Depends on where you want to go....
I don't know how....
You're impossible....
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
The kind with an umbrella in it....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I borrow it without telling him....
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I can't....
I'll get it back next time.
Hurry!
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Stop farting around....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Hey!
What happened to Clarence and...?
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
How long have you known Hoagie?
Who?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
'A Moray eel....'
Shit....
Stop that!
You told me what?
What the hell are you doing?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Jake.
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
Where's Lenny?
Cow tipping?
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Did you bring it with you?
Be my guest. What you got?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
What do you think?
Yeah, he can go ...
How's the new residence?
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
We're going.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
You believe me, don't you?
Did he shut you down?
Why's she blind, Bro?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
What about Citrine?
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
What if we need a back up?
How do you know her hair's black?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Did he get you the job?
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
You must have some idea about him.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
What are you reading?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I know what you're like ..
You know? How do you know?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
You do?
What are you doing, Travis?
Who sought the warrant?
What was she like?
What does that mean?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
So tonight she confesses?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
He's asleep, right?
Now what did you lose?
Oh tsht. Yes.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
It's all going to work.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Don't worry about it, boss.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Oh God.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Oh, thank you.
What happened to Denver?
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Rod --
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
No, I air-dry.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
What's wrong.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
The kid is amazing.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why not --
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Marcee --
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
... dick?
Jerry --
They do, my brother.
I don't see any.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
No, Dr. Grant says...
What?
Young adult.
That's him. Thats Eric!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
You had the phone the whole time?
Where's Dad?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
They never got that big.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
I CAN GET HIM!
Hmm?
He used to know me.
Anything good?
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Know what this is?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Do you have any kids?
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
Hmmm.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You hear something?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I don't believe you.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Dad!
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
What is?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
It's... behind... us.
What's he got in there?
Their what?
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No.
Lava?
Come on!
I think she's with Sarah!
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Because it exists.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
These formations.  They're dried --
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Hold it down, Nick!
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
You shouldn't use my name.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
I have samples all over the kitchen.
Carousel.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh, shit.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, com one!!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
I know, it's very exciting.
It's anti-nature.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Alan, listen to this.
Dino droppings?
Yes?
What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Are they heavy?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
Tim.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
Straight-A brainiac!
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Go, go, go, jump!
What?  What can we do?
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Can't you stop these things?!
Ah - - they're here.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Tim!  Lex!
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I'm a hacker!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
That's not true...
I think we're lost.
Hello?
Two.
What?
What are the charges?
A house?
He wets the bed?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
Cute waitresses?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Ten minutes...
You work in the insurance department?
Have you worked here long?
Fine -- terrible.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
You work in the cemetery.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
A true friend would do it.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You wanted to see me, sir.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
What?
When I have no reason to doubt.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
They're not obliged to tell.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Was he depressed?
... A piece of paper ...
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Women are all you have on your mind!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Then that's the place for us!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Where do I charter a boat?
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
I tell you it doesn't exist!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
What's that?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Uh uh.
-- May I? It's so --
Guess!
I do not love him.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
What was better? I made better bait?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
What is it?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
How else do you meet them? Pimps?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Well do you think it was him?
Can't you get him?
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
Is there anything more I could --
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
What's the matter?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
The same as Jane McKenna.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
How can you do it to yourself?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Go down in my room.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
You wanted to, or you are?
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
What?
Where, how?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
You must be discouraged.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
I know Tom Grunemann.
No.
Well?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
Uh, huh...
Okay...Same as usual...
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Sleep tight.
See you in the morning light.
Are you going to get remarried?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
What did you do when you were little?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Sustained.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Did you wish to?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Is that...permanent?
I was not a failure.
Where are you going?
How's the new job?
He looks like a terrific kid.
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
So...what's so terrible about that?
And?
What?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Oh, Christ!
I lost him?  I lost him?
I'll take my chances.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
What are you going to do?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
California?
What d'you tell her?
Thelma, if I die--
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
No.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Yes.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Cow.
Me. First break of day.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
I need to squeeze this brain.
Will we be in this war?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
America, we shall see.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
Me?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Yes.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
Am I running away?
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Much too young.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
It seems like we're getting lower.
I might get a shot.
Around here.  Yeah.
Jesus Christ!!
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Was he a good man?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
I got something on the screen.
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Kelly Scott.
How big do the bears get?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Okay.  We're up at six.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Like little children.  You okay?
No thanks.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Thing we can lift it?
What?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Are we crazy?
It can't work.
Watch out!!
Different worlds, Jack.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
What's that?
Are they feeding?
Now I'm gonna puke.
If you get a safe shot...
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
Not yet.
You're sort of a rude person.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
What is this?
Are you alright?
Hank?
Are you okay?
Did you get him?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Kelly.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
That's not what you came to say.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
I'm not even a field person.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
You and Kevin.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Myra.
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
No. He won't come after me.
"- every day."
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Why?
Are you finished?
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
What would it take?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Thank you, Clarice.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Yes, miss.
Are you alright?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Why didn't you bury those people?
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Much further?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
Some say that's the way of it.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
I don't understand!
Got a reason to stay.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
What a place for them...
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
First rank! Second rank! Present arms!
Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Such as...?
The honors of war?
Le mot d'ordre?
Why Sixpack?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Be careful with it.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
I thought they were your friends?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
How's astronaut training?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
They know, don't they?
We're on backup air.
We made it!
The internal monitors read normal.
What about our quota?
Something wrong, Cobb?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
You got money in this tub?
Listen to it for Christsake.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
Look.  Water.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Who were you talking to?
What is it?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
How much did you part with?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Well?
I thought this was a pub.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
JD.
Have you counted the money?
Son, have a look in his locker.
You all right back there, mate?
What are you doing?
How long has he been in there, son?
Is he on his own?
Is that you, Dean?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
What they like then?

Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Yeah, one of them's out.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
You got it all?
That you, boy?
It's pay day, ain't it?
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Look. Go on, look.
My van is half full.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Where did you get those from, a museum?
What's left over?'
How many wings have they got between them?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I don't know what the big deal is.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
That isn't true.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
You're dismissed, Private.
You're dismissed.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
That the word on our boy?
Nice job.
Charley Wade.
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
What's that for?
Whole different story; isn't it?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Same weight I always was.
Best part of the job.
Come on in--
You've been in this house for a while?
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
Didn't have a father?
I have a B average.
How's your room shaping up?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
We been through this before--
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Black Seminoles?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
So.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
Eladio Cruz.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
You have somebody else out there?
This girl has a child?
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That's a matter of interpretation--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
I haven't been out here for a while.
He still living?
Besides my father, I mean.
I got an idea what happened.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
There was a mandate in the last election--
Steve called for you.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
There must have been somebody.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
And my father?
People didn't complain?
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
What's she singing about?
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
Murdered him?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
So why did you come back here, Sam?
I mean what did we know about anything?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
How much?
Hello, L.A.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
You did.  Didn't you?
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
I'll tell you.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Will you come to him on your knees?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
And are you afraid?
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Sorry.  You asked.
So why did you marry him?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Oh Christ.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
You said you weren't with him for love.
What then?
Harry?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
What were you doing up there?
Are you finished with me?
They weren't worth a damn.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
What are you, my mother?
Whose is the car?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
What's the difference?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Who is she?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I can't let you in.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
I only wear ties for funerals.
Look, Ma, no wires.
Yes! Yes!
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
What about you? Why are you here?
How long have you been married?
What did you study?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
Charlotte, who?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
I don't remember.
And marriage, does that get easier?
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
No one ever tells you that...
You made it.
It's for my daughter.
It's bad isn't it?
You think so?
Where's your husband?
Do you know where we are?
What do you want to drink?
I'm sorry.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Do you like massage?
My stockings.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Oh, come on.
What?
I guess she's busy.
Hello?
Ok.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Like popcorn?
Yeah.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Lauren?
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Oh no...
You never said anything to me...
I spaced out.
What?  That's horrible!
I found them in your file box.
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Yes.
Seemed...on edge.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
He spoke to you?
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
You fucking bastard.
Why are you doing this to me?
Well I know he's come here before.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
And also that...
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
I do.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
You know what?  You can go.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Yeah.
Good of you to stop by.
What's this?
What happened?
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
So what do I do?
That's not it.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
What are you talking about?
Okay.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
So you're still breast-feeding?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
What?
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Sorry.
You could make a career by telling me where.
You might be the only one with a job.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
No.
Hey, munchkin.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
You shoot like a girl.
What's up with that?
Thanks.
You ever think about going back?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So how come you could play basketball?
I think we gotta kiss now.
So?
So she's honest.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Didn't know you cared so much.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
I won.
Sorry about your game.
Least she had time for me.
Stay!
Just something I'm trying.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Cause I don't get it.
What's going on?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
What will this prove?
And what happens when you lose?
No.
Give it yourself.
We should head over.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Not great.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You hearing me?
How was your game?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Why not?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Sorry.
What's Mom think?
And some things should never fucking happen!
I ain't a damn liar.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
After five years.
Good.
You smell like trouble --
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Oh, she's fine.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
Don't sit down.
I don't wanna talk to you.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
Honey.
Wilson.
Yeah, but I don't know --
No.
Yeah.
No.
No.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
This is my job.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
It's ok.
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
What's your name?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Where's the news department at this studio?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
It's ok --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
What?  What does that mean?
You see?
I'm sick.
You mind your own bussines.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
He has Phil right now.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Hello?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
All it takes is one second?
I'm gonna start rolling --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I would just want to clear some things up:
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
She lived in Tarzana.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Yeah.
Are you close?
I'm sorry.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Do you have your masters?
And "Frank?"
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
He's in here --?
There's no disturbance.
I don't have to answer your questions.
You're here.
No.  I said that.
No I Said.
I didn't do anything.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
What the hell is this Marcie?
You look great.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Yeah. Yes.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Will you say my name?
I'm sorry.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Come home soon after the show.
-- did she talk to you?
I love you.
No.
Just once.
I don't know....
I'm Bob.
Can I come in?
Was it a call back?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
Are you on drugs right now?
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
What would you like?
Ok.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
What is it, mother?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Louis, please -- !
How can I serve you in this?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
And people close to him, who --
What you're asking is impossible!
Aramis, this will never --
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
A simple theological discussion.
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Where are we?
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
Coming?
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
It worked!
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
But -- are you sure?
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Die?  What...?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
It's been too long.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
Raoul is everything to me.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Recent hours have been a shock.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
One for all.  All for one.
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Phillippe!
Food, moron.
You've... memorized...?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Exactly why it should be given away.
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Shall I leave?
What can I do for you?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Every step of the way.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
What the hell happened?
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Find out for me.
Let's roll -
I'll take the south end -
Well don't you think that's odd?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Are you alright?
Where up north?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
What's going on here?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
Are you going to be alright?
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
What?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
How long do I have?
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Get him to Atlanta.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
It's not over yet.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
Who is it?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
What am I doing here?
Do you see?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
I want to see Lecktor now.
He's very strong physically.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
'Intimate? !"
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
To do what?
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Do you remember what you said?
And... where are things?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
What's this Mama shit?
Yes. Is Molly there?
Lt. Fisk said...
What do you want?
Yes. Who are you?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
You went in the apartment?
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
Yes, I thought so.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Why should I tell you?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
I'm sorry, George...
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
What was that all about?
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
My hair is coming out.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
B-but I have them.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Excuse me -- ?
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi...
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why Memphis?
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
You're NOT DYING!
You're not listening to me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Give me the book.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
Sir, do you have a problem?
I was very original!
"Philosophically"?
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Positive.
"Burlesque"?
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Bob.
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
A -- a tourist.
He'll be contacting us again.
You don't know.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Weird.
What?!
You got the money?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Did you hear that?
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
No, it's all right.
Is that...?
Do you always look at it encoded?
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
What is he doing?
How?!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
How did I beat you?
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
You're the Oracle?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
My name is Trinity.
What?
Who is?
From what?
Get this thing out of me!
You can't!
What are you doing?
No, you're not.
How?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Which way?  Which way?
It's locked.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
We need an exit!
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
What are your plans?
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Get out of here before this really goes up.
Where to?
Waddaya think?
Nah.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Keep your mouth shut.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Back so soon.
I think we should see your uncle.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Don't count it...it's all there.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Hey... you got stereo.
Look who's talking.
I hate parties --
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
-- Black.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
What is this?
I don't like cake.
I haven't been the father to you that --
And that?
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
Hello, Beautiful.
Drew, you're out of line.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
No.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
I'm all excited --
Have we met?
No.
Why?
Mind if I throw up?
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
In English, please.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Yeah.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Jennifer.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
How long you here, Joe?
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
You think so?  How do you know?
'Big'?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
Yes?
Joe --
Oh goodness, no.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
No.
-- Could you?
Yes?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
He's taking a nap.
Where are you going?
But there's so much to tell you --
Did I say that?
That's it?
What a good idea.
How long have I got?
Good morning.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
What way would you put it?
And I don't give a shit.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Then what is it?
So that's what love is?
No.
Are you threatening me?
Okay.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
I think you know --
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
'Take me'...?  Where?
What the hell are you talking about?
The 'question' --
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
This one.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Drew's aboard?
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
What is it, Daddy --?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
What?!
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
That was wonderful.
This is crazy --
I love him.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Not at all.
I've got patients coming in --
78.
Slam it?
That's it?
Hiya.
You don't know?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Jimmy?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Why?
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Yeah.
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
What?
It's not easy to be calm when -
What do the police think?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Did you?
What happened?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
You're the memory guy?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Lenny, is that you?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Why's that?
Why?
Like what?
How do you know this?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
This is a drug deal?!
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
What cop?
Bullshit.							*
What was it for?							   *
And...?
I don't know.
What's "nothing"?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Where's that?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Your father?
I insist.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Where would I go?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Anything?
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Where the hell are you, man?
Where'd you go?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Never heard of him.
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Yeah...?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
That sonofabitch!
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
What do you care?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
The Statue of Liberty.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
He's got taxi fare.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
You got a comb?
Tell her, Ratso.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Sounds like they knew you.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
You're what?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
What you got me up here for?
Listen, I gotta have money.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
You got it.
Sold. Let's go.
Get lost.
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
Want me to take over?
To what?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Dad...I'm...
Yeah. How's Mom?
Where you staying, Dad?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Sixty Lira?
Just what?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
What's your father do?
Girlfriend?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
How's it feel?
Just Erich.
Feeling all right?
What they give you?
Hello, Billy.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
What's wrong?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
Oh we... we...
It's already been cut.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
What lawyer?
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
And a right.
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
A mistake.
He's special.
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you doing down here?
We're no leaving you!
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Honey, just leave it.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Oh, no, you were-
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Don't.
No, Jesus, no.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
What's this?
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
What do you want to know?
I'm not much of a critic.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
What's your new book called?
Thank you so much.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
It'll only take a second.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Well, it certainly says you.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Paul, I know you've been out.
You've been out of your room.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Yeah. They're in the semis.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I thought you were going to dinner.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
How grateful?
On what.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
Sort it all out.
Nyah!
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Range is two kay.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
What are you doing here?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- right..where is it?
- this is very disconerting..
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Hola..
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Awfully short notice..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
I managed.
Are you okay?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
An idea, yeah.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
And then what?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Yes, I believe that's right.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Roger that.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Luther, say again.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
What kind of show.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Did we get it?
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
You were in the car!
What?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
May I come in?
Claire.
Yes.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
What?
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
Merci.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Claire.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
The package is in the open.
I thought I was going to see Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I thought I'd take some now.
Tell you what?
He won't be back in a hurry?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Whatís going to make him do that?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Jim...?
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
That's what we do isn't it?
Such a nice ass.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Itís working.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
I don't like him.
I have no money!
I don't wanna talk about it.
Cosmo?
Have I been a good wife?
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Rose, pass the wine.
You haven't said anything.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
It's temporary.
You're married.
You're my father.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
I like it well done.
How'd he die?
How many men since then?
Son of a bitch!
I was dead.
What about Johnny?
It's so bright.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I'm telling you you can't.
So. Where are we sitting?
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
This is your place.
This is where we're going!
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
I like this ring.
How near is she to death?
Alright. A month. In a month.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
I have no secrets from my family.
WHAT?
How's the mother?
What! How do you know?
What the hell happened to you?
Hi.
No.
Alright.
Don't fight.
Maybe I should go?
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Have you come to make peace with me?
Yes?
Can I get another one of these?
Do you have a girlfriend?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
Nerves.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
I don't know.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
How do you know she is a witch?
I see.  Yes, of course.
You're using coconuts!
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
The same!
A what?
What, "is"?
I move for no man.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Are you sure he's got one?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Who ... Who breaks out?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
By what name are you known?
Where?
Je...sus Christ!
Oh, shut up.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
I think I'll go for a walk.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
They cost fifty pounds each!
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Father, lad.
Herbert.
But I don't like her.
Who are you?
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
Right.
The Castle Anthrax?
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well ...
Sir Galahad!
... I Bet you're gay.
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
Stop saying the word!
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
Not bad, not bad.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
What did you say?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
Checked and locked, sir.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Awaiting my orders.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
This is a slur on her good name.
What brings you here?
Dare say you can be taught.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
You're injured.
Oh.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Too busy looking after themselves.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
I came as quickly as I could.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
This is my good John Brown.
We're going to lose.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
How long has he been this sick?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Who told them that?
There is one other matter.
What do they want?
Where is my son?
Why is he not here?
What is the matter with him?
What's the riddle?
How the hell did you do that?
Dead?
What's her problem?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Nick...
No, in person.  Now.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
So how did it know my name, then?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
Where to now?
That's what I thought.
SLIP-STREAM.
Jesus Christ!
What are you looking for?
You're not coming, Alex.
Okay.  It's West.
We can't reach that!
So that's what we almost died for?
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Which way?
It's here!!!
What did he do to you?
Mom?  You're alive...
But I don't understand...
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
But I'm not broke.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
What did I say?
... What??
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
I...
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Your Aunt called me.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Betty.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Was anyone hurt?
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
There's nothing?
What's wrong with that?
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"Before I kill you."
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Don't stop!
No, we don't.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
You see what I mean...
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
The one of 'em still alive?
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
No...
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
So what do we do ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
You took an awful big risk back there.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Yeah a real shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
Is it over ?
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
Stop the hydraulics.
Trust is earned not given away.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
So who are these people with the Boss ?
What was that ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
What the ... ?
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
Umm, where do you want this?
I don't think you're very polite.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Do what?
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
No nuns, got it.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
What happened to Shelly?
We have a baby?
I don't know if I want to.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
See you? He can smell you from there.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
This is really very nice of you.
Hi there...can I help you?
Vada?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Get married?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You ratted on my mother??
I think it's cool.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Does it work?
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
It's not his fault!
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Yeah?
Write me a poem?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Maybe.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
He was caressing.
Excuse me?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Why not now?
Wanna play?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
You're such a baby.
Of what??
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
Well the other night at dinner...
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Yeah.
This is where we are.
Rock?
Shelly?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Are they ready yet?
Yes..
I like the freak show.
Hi Vada.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Oh yes, oh that's great.
No, no no....
Hi.
Sure.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
How much does it cost?
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Is that your camper?
He won't give it to me.
Are you married?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
NO!
How old are you?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
At what?
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
It doesn't work, it always stays black.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Hurry!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It's a mosquito bite.
Hey look at this!
Do you remember her?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Here.
Sorry.
Bed wetter!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Can we go yet?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Got it!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
So now you'll have a mother.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
We'll never be the same.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Zit cream?
Neosporin?
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Needing.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
But he sure can kiss.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
I mean, he loves his job.
So... one almost has to...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
I saw the show.
Is anybody watching?
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Please come, please.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
You're not eating.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Dance card filled?
Where did we first hear th...
No accents today.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Michael? What ha...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
What happened?
Thank God you were here.
... your one chance for true happiness?
What's up?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
Almost three.
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Barnett, please -
You have to what?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
You going today?
Yes.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Have you talked to Triplette?
He has that sign with the tree.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
How much?
Where'd he ever see us?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Come on. He's a crook.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
You want me to wait?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
You know anything about the stations here?
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
How do you know?
You must really like him.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
Wrecks.
What kind?
I don't know his first name.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Do you ever do any writing?
Do you like him?
Who is thin?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
How old are you?
You know who that is?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Oh, no.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
I'm Opal.
Why?
He is to a lot of people.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
More or less.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
You got something you want to do?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Yeah.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
How is it?
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Describe Mallory.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Yeah baby.
Yes.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Roger, no.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger?
And where do you keep Mickey?
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Ya know, I was.
It sure is.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Yeah.
They done that too long in my family.
Give her a beer.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
'You Duff Anderson?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Thanks.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
They must work on the section gang.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
How come you stay 'round here?
Not here, Duff.
No, on the porch.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
How old is your boy?
Hi.
How did it go?
Thank you.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Everything you cook is good.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Don't look so scared.
Don't, Duff.
Don't deny me, Duff.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
You heard me!
Duff, I love you.
Where're you going to go?
Like a home, for one thing.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
What happened?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
What did you say, boy?!
Come on, Pop.
They'll run you out.
Hello.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Shut up, Will.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Your Raoul?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
You're hurt...
What you lookin' for, mon?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
And then?
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Who got you into this?
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Hello, Case.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
And we really do have to talk.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
I gotta know... did it work>
I'm going in.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Case... Are you alright?
Is he going to make it?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
What?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Oh, man! Who told?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
No Roger from op/ed?
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Anita!
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Hi!
What is this?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
He is totally crunching on you.
You've done five of my ideas.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Josie Grossie.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Into our group.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Wow - I-
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Where're we taking him?
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Uh-huh.
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
You two got a thing going, or what?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
What are you doing here?
You're fucked in the head.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I feel like a jerk.
Yeah?
What is it - What's wrong?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Yor dad picking the music again?
What's that?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Freddy?
What's that?
Are you okay?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
You got five minutes.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Crossed over?
Tell me about the kids.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
This is nice.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Just until we get things under control.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
I can't believe I just did that.
Then maybe you're ready.
The truth.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Somebody else is out here.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Why is he after us?
I'm in.
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Lovely to meet you.
No!
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Oh Jesus.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Are you busy tonight?
Okay -- fine.
Okay.
Floppy, huh?
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
No, I didn't.
Hi.  Can I come in?
Yup.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You've got big feet.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Oh please sod off.
Wow.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Can I have your autograph?
Where are you going?
No.  Not true...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
What happened?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Right -- want another one?
Well?
Any more announcements?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Which was?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Oh my God...  Hello.
Maybe.
Yes.
Are you sure you...?
Excuse me.
The one down your trousers.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Yes, Billy?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Get up, Billy.
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
I hope everything is settled.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
So long, kid.
Yeah, kid?
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
In there.
Wait a minute...
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
There they are!
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
Ya know what, Fred?
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Twenty-five dollars.
It doesn't help him.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
Don't you have any clubs?
Hear what?
Who told you that?
Yeah, buddy?
Hit me!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Oh, what's that?
Is that so?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Poker!
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Oh yeah...
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Yeah!
There they are!
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
How 'bout twenty?
What kind of crap is that???
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
She was your sister.
Your mother.
Excuse me?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
What?...
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
A very large pig.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
That's not the point.
How could you do this to me?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Why are you doing this?
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Yes.  I am.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Been here long?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
I'll look forward to it.
Excuse me?
So, what are we waiting for?
Come on, it's not so bad.
But what?
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Have you seen him with someone?
I have vacation time coming to me.
Live happily ever after.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
Your brother?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
He's heeeeeerrre...
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Faith--
That was really sweet...
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
It was a ouija board, remember?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Maybe I can change him.
He's a jerk.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
Yeah--
And you didn't tell her?
Where is she?
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Working hard?
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Mmhmm.
Mmhmmm.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Wow... .
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
I want to be a teacher.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I can get home all right from here
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What's that?
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I'd better go in.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
The Golden Warriors.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Want to go out and have one with me?
A dive? You mean, into the water?
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
And if you don't?
You haven't finished your beer.
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Terry, for God's sake.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Am I on my feet...?
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
But you've got to listen to me.
I want to see you, Terry.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Your gun.
Give me that gun.
You all right, Nolan?
What do you think?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You was a Golden Warrior.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Do you?
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You got some nerve.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Something's making that music.
What do you mean?
Look!
What can we do?
You're talking nonsense.
But they are not yet one of us.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
What're you talking about?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Ask him his name.
You're good.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
It's Richard Ripley.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Where in the hell are we?
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Oh, man.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
How long were you with the girl?
You talked to him?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
You know how to use one a these?
Nervous?
That's funny.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
None of your business.
That's my dad.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Don't leave me.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
You really wear that suit.
You're not dumb.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
Take your sunglasses off.
Weren't you expecting us?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I hear six.
Looks like tonight.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Foley?  That you?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
The <u>ninth</u>?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
You don't remember me, do you?
Do we have a gun in the car?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Gee, I wonder why not.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
It's a guy you know.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
I'm looking for Maurice.
No.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Out for the evening?
You here all by yourself?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
What?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Midge.
I found a rubber.
...the fuck is this...
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Do you always stutter?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
It's Germans!
How could you do this?
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
I didn't mean it.
We gotta face some facts here.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
It's tight.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
Don't get smart with me, son.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Well sure, Colonel --
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Rafe --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
I have'na been able ta --
Let's go.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Welcome to the singles scene.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
We're going to take you home.
I don't get it.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Peggy Sue!
We're here on the sofa bed...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Charlie, how are you?
Charlie, let's make love.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Charlie. About last nights..
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Does this mean you like me again?
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I thought you were...for a while.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Are you for real?
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Coffee and a donut.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Damn that Charlie I
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
What happened to you?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Maddy's party.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Don't eat the red ones.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Like what?
Silicon is from sand.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
What happened to you?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
What are you talking about?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
Why not?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
It's weird...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Thanks, you guys.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
I'm not ready to die.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
My lover and I.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
I buy that.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
There is no relevant precedent.
PARRTYY!
What do you want?
You survived your first gay party intact.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Some do. I didn't.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Hello?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
Objection!
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Since when?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Right.
Not when I was in the Navy.
You taught him a lesson.
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Julius!
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Oh, Lord....
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
What about her?
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Hey.
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Smoke screen for what?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
So you noticed too?
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
This does not help us, Johns.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Well? Is it just the pump?
Owens!
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Frightening thought.
One is all?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Hasan?
Imam. Slow down.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
"God is Great," yes?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
So much for your nightfall.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Dr. Zaius --
How did you know we'd come here?
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Taylor, I'd rather you -
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
The blood transfusion.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
Well, maybe they're not.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Any particular reason?
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Hmph.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
He's trying to form words.
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
She comes along too.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
ThatÕs a lie!
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
No.
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Tell him to pull back!
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Sure.	In a cage.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Listen-
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Sarge?
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
What you got there - beers?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Whew! - where that come from?
You wanted to see me sir?
You don't want to hear about it?
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Vancouver, B.C.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
What's the matter?
The brush-off, huh?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Nice of him.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Certainly not to me.
Cold?
Then he's got to be a detective.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Us?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
See anything?
In a way.
Mine?
I'll have to know a little more than that.
That's an evasion and you know it.
What this?
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I expected nothing else.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
But even if you were in love with me.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Private eye?
What are your rates?
Got it on you?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
How are your teeth getting along?
What's this in favor of?
Thank you.
Time for a little chat?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Information.
Mitchell was too drunk.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
You in charge here?
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Where's the shell?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
May you what?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
And if you didn't believe me?
So far.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
How long have you had it?
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Terrific.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
I'll have some of that.
Good.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Oh, but he was terrific.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
I called you a taxi.
Me too.
In radio we're different.
Shall we have a drink or something?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Not bad.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
You're so famous now.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Ah, Susy, it...
And that's why you never went pro?
Friends of yours, huh?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
How you figure?
One shot stopping.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
You gonna pull?
Talk.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
We're wasting time.
I'm not armed.
Where's Roach?
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Got it.
I know where they're going.
This gonna take long?
Who's the girl?
You had enough?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
I... I gotta go.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Why us?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
What's got Billy so spooked?
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Mmmnnn...?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
It's... it's not like that.
What's that long building over there?
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Mr. Harris.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
That's ridiculous.
Nice car.  Yours?
New York.
For the whole night?
What's your name, lover.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Good morning.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
Vivian --
But you want days too.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Did you buy some clothes?
This isn't a date.
Hello?
You're upset, huh?
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
What if someone tries to steal it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Why do you want to know?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
All this because of that whore!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
You sure you won't come with me?
You bullshittin' me?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
What is with you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Yes?
Having a good time, Vivian?
What?
Get out!
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Every ship but the four you sent.
I killed him myself.
He knows I do not love him.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
But what if something happens to you?
Can you move at all?
We'll never survive.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
What?
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
You're quick.
Why is that, do you think?
Why should that make such a difference?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I only dog paddle.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
The Man in Black?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
-- wait, just wait --
Westley's only faking, right?
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
No.
What? What?
Sixty-five.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Humiliations galore!
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
How old were you?
You're amazing!
I must know.
Kill me quickly.
Go in, get after her!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Let me explain-
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
-- get back, witch --
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Yeah, an hour.
Think it'll work?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
But that's cheating!
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
You're going to jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
To failure!
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Max, I...
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Vat about it?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Do you need us?
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Feeling better?
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
I solemnly swear...
Nietzche...
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Okay.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
You out to buy a motel?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Not at all!
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Let's all talk about Mary.
I don't know.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
She haven't even called you?
Where... can I stay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Probably on his way back right now.
Stay here.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
The only girlish thing you have lost.
For what?
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
You have something most girls never have.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
A man should have a hobby.
Is your time so empty?
You go out... with friends?
You should... mind it.
Except you.
Thank you, Norman.
Frankly, yes.
Is there?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Wait a minute!
We have a problem.
Norman took a wife?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll get your bags.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
Just before she died she came to--
Did you wish to see someone?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
How do you do.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
What's down there?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
What is it now?
Yes, why?
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Let me go! Let me go!
What! What are you talking about?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Meaning what?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Call the Homicide Squad!
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
You weren't going with her?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Why?
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
How much money have you got?
Is that a fact?
To lunch.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
What are you laughing at?
Yep. Everything settled.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Mia...?
What?
Of what?
What did it want?
Dysfunctional --
Why?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
I got an awful toothache.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
I do, too!
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
Let's go peep from the living room.
He kissed her.
He had his hand on her titty.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
So am I.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Are they polar bears, too?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Of course.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Well, she's back.
Quarter of twelve.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She hasn't actually done anything...
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Is this ill right?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Your baby?
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Galley what?
Took your time gettin' here.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
No more dentists, no more dentists...
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I was going to tell him.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
You think it's that good?
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
When you planning to cut back on that?
Dean Martin.
They... they shot me.
Gimmie a butt.
Birth control's important.
It doesn't say that.
Hey...
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
General Jim Beam, then.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
Our resignations.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Can't I?
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Arriving tonight
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
That's not true.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
There's still good in him.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Yes, my Master.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
They are clear, my Master.
Are you all right?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Lando, grab it!
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Here we go again.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Oh!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Yoda, I must know.
Yes or no will do.
How many languages do you speak?
You!
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
What was that bang?
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Hello.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
What a guy
"Transylvania"
Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...Guess.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
...I dunno.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Oh, Rocky!
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Nine minutes!
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Ya still light seventy.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
More like thirty.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Fifty years, huh.
...What?
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Really think so?
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
How am I doin'?
See how fast he is -- damn!
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Hey --
Ya always in a bad mood --
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
It don't bother me none.
I'll do okay.
Ya really like her?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
You ballin' her?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Do you feel you have a chance?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
What the hell is that?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
When will I hear from you?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
I'll get it.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Two bits.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Good marrow, father!
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
I will follow you.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
It's under your seat.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I better be getting that.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
American.
Yeah.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
You should watch what you eat.
Cigarette?
Something like that...
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I needed to know.
I borrowed that, too...
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
And what job is that?
I'm going with you.
Clearly.
The Irish representative?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I never made that claim.
They don't have the package.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Let's get him out of here...
You son-of-a-bitch...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What happened to it?
Why's that?
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Can you get it?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
No.  We can't.
It won't work.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
I don't know...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
He's going to be trouble.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Do you have everything?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
I'm all ears.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
OK.  I love you.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Sally, do you love me?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
And what's that?
What?
Why?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Yeah.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
A lot of men come in here?
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
She's not his type.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Hey where's the hot pad?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
What are you saying?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
We're out of here.
Don't hurt me.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
Are you hungry?
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
The band has been playing over an hour.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
I'm busy at the moment.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Carter, get off that stage!
I'm sorry.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Well, hurry up.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
It's my job!
Carter?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
You're not very good at this, are you?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
No, no, that would be crazy --
It sounds impossible --
Follow the Rich White Man?
Who?
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Are you okay?
I think we should stop talking.
Are you serious?
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Lee!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
We made it, man.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
First class.
What's going on?
Are you okay?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
You speak English!
It's the same thing!
Right....
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
What?!
Which one?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Like that.
Oh no, I dropped it.
What are you doing here?
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Jesus...what do you want?
You don't like it?
Any demands yet?
How much they want?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Hmmmm?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You a cop or something?
Hello.
I do.
I would like one of my people to help.
I am so sorry about your men.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
What is he up to now?
See you at the wedding.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Fisher, let him talk.
Maggie!
Look, he's running after her.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
In vino veritas.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
Really?
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
Always a mood killer.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Kind of isolated.
Where did you disappear to?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I already explained about that.
What!?
To who?  Are you asking me?
And the church.
Yes, I did.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Who is it?
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
I do.
Walter.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
Oh!
What was that about up there?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
What?
I love you, too.
You don't know who she was, Annie --
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
What about the letter?
I love the symphony.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Hello.
It's you.
Hello.
All righ...
Where's your mom?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Dad, could you close the door?
Do you want a fruit plate?
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
I'm starting to forget her.
This one's for both of us.
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
God, she's beautiful.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
What's wrong with Annie?
Did too.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
Yes?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
It's a little derivative.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Is he there?
He's ten.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Are you sick, Mama?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
You know I don't think that.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
No ...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
Yeah.
How?
It's not that easy.
Is that how you play?
It gets me through the day.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
I'm kind of busy.
We been through that.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Don't get carried away.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Why?
What the hell is that?
But...I've seen you.
No one ever noticed?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
By not disgracing her memory!
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You're serious?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Come on, guys ...
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Shoot him.
Now get talkin'
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
You don't find that repugnant?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
What're your taking down?
This the guy?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Jimmy?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
We're in business.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Sir?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Y'all come back.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Not yet.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
It seemed appropriate.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Caen?
Beasley's dead.
You get a translator, Captain?
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
What do you think?
What are we going to do?
Uh, oh.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
I don't think so, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Up.  We're moving out.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Goddamn it!
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Shit, sir.
Damn fool.  Sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
So, where are you from?
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
How can you, how can you say that?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Thanks, I like yours too.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Lloyd?
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
You're tough, J-man.
But you never had a first date.
That's not even a scam.
Then what's love?
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Please?
So, what's your point?
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Lloyd is doomed.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Goodnight.
Do you love him?
Honey!
I made their lives better.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yeah.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Actually, I think that I...
Well...
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Sure I do.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Yeah.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Yes.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Okay, this is important...
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Are you comfortable?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
I think that we should spend some time apart.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you talk to Corey?
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
Okay.
Good to know.
It's your castle, man.
PAIN!
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Certainly.
Now you're back.
You know what, you'd like her.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You took my workers.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
Like this?
How you feeling, all right?
What's wrong with it?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Oskar, good of you to come.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
What others?
I was just the accountant.
Pots and pans.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
How's the name search going?
Have you checked the...
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said goodbye?
WHAAAATT?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
Where's Sid?
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
I never meant to imply...
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
They're roomates.
Let's go.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
You're getting obvious.
I'm sorry.
I dont know.
That was good.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Hello?
She's not here right now.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
What was that?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Jesus.  Hello?
Who is this?
What kind of a game?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Where are you?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Nope.
Did you request this case?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Oh yeah, how?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Detective Kincaid?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Thank you.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Geez.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
You're not happy with your part.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
It's Sarah.
No.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
You're dead!
WHERE?
Owwww...
How'd you do?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
You rode your bike out there?
Billy? What the...
My dad's in the other room.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Sshh... it's okay.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Uh-huh.
Hello?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
Who are you trying to reach?
I think you have the wrong number.
What?
Popcorn.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Is this some kind of a joke?
What do you want?
Please don't hurt him.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
Michael... Michael Myers.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
So is Dewey your real name?
I like it. It's... sexy.
What are you doing here?
Does mom know?
Should I be worried?
She's tough.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Jesus...
Where is she?
About thirty seconds.
I'm not here to fight.
Off the record. No cameras.
You owe my mother.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
You're evil.
I have no idea.
Are you alone in the house?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
Stu was with me last night.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't come any closer.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Do you believe this shit?
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
TATUM!
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
What do you think?
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Have you heard?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
How you feeling?
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
Give me the gun.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
A woman...
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
I... I don't follow.
Drop it.
You think it was poison?
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
It could be nothing.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
It's too soon for him.
It's my wife.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
He's preaching.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Nothing.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
What are you going to say?
Think about it...
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
We could use about fifty more men here.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Oh, you want to stay now?
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
You know he's fucking us.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
But Mose Harper said...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
What in...?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Well, the reward still stands...
Told ya, didn't I?
That's what I said.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Well, come on!
Nothing for you to see.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Say it. We're beat!
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Hey! What's the idea...?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Futterman?
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Comancheros...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
She's not a little girl any more.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Where?
Why else?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
I have to cut his windpipe...
Ellen, move aside...
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Cherry-red Tears.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
She was old.
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
I really hate to bother him, but...
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
No, I've never seen him before.
Do I look like it that much?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Well, look here!
WillWhere is Mercutio?
Ah
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
We have no Juliet!
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Are you writing?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
And your relations?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
No Juliet?!
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Now where? Will?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Nobody. The author.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
By God, I wish I knew.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Ethel.
This is a different one.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Be good to her, my lord!
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
What do you love so much?
"I know not."
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Better fortune, boy.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
I do not know how to undress a man.
You would not leave me?
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, do not go
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Will you read it for me?
"thou need'st not to be gone."
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
I have spoken with your father.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Good morning, my lord!
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
And break her heart and mine?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
But what of Lord Wessex?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
What's his name?
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You know what I'm talking about.
I won't be able to.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
They know.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Are you recording it?
No. Why should it?
That's right.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
Well, she had problems --
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
Have you seen Hugo?
Maybe he didn't like us.
So?
Alex.
Don't.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
No.
I don't see the point in that.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
We could put it somewhere.
I refuse.
What?
So, uh...
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Two?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Yes.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Expecting anyone?
Yes.
Hello.
You must be Hugo.
No.
Do you think you could answer that?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Working nights?
For what?
I suppose so.
Offering it for debate.
I thought you were in a good mood.
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That's George.
-- is that right?
What're you looking for?
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Your husband?
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
That you're just like your mother.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Yes, Buffums.
You do it.
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
Where do you want to do this?
You would?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
No! Don't! Please!
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- what guy?
What are you looking at?
-- what?
Me?
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- Jesus --
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
I'm busy, man.
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Call me!
There were some shots.
I just... who what?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're different.
George.
I already said hello.
Whether or not I'm going.
When is that, George?
What?
I know, honey.
What does he direct besides traffic?
Now, Jackie --
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight, George.
Bullshit.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
-- and take this with you.
What do you wanna know for?
What difference does it make?
-- please, baby --
George...
What're you here for?
Said what!
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Sorry, honey, I...
I know it, I know it.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Sit down.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Me!
What took you so long?
No you won't.
I was too old.
Who were you talking to?
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
-- you phony asshole --
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, he is.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
We don't think marriage is important.
-- Yeah, honey...
How much?
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- uhh-huhh...
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Sort of.
I'm terribly sorry.
Good for you.
George? Was he alone?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
-- there's not much room --
Do you have children?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Call me Les.
Dad?
I'm hungry.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
How's it going, Doc?
Yes.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Yes.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Jack...
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Red Rum.
Is Tony one of your animals?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Shall we go into the living room?
It's okay, really.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
No.
How?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
No charge?
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
As soon as possible.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me.
Stop it!
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Very nice to meet you.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
I don't believe they did.
Well, obviously some people can be
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Went shopping. Why?
You booger.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
There's something else scary.
I've been hearing noises in there.
You all right, Marty?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
What if I say no?
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Okay, Christy -- strip.
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Where did that come from?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Is this... choir practice?
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
Come on, we're late.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
We need experience.
Who are all these people?
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
The reason?
And all those like you.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
And the vow of chastity.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Really catching on.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
Ten flights?
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I am?
I have?
Vince knows you're here.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
We're looking for Mike.
Vince -- is she... okay?
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
Well?
I can't see anything in here!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
A sweater.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
An... entertainer?
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
We both missed.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
They spend two days in chains.
You must have missed your mark.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
It is sacrilege!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Damn... damn... damn...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Thank you.
We are leaving.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
All I saw was their lantern.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What books?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
How are you?
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
These scars.  How did you get them?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
People have put their trust in you.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
It is only me.
I apologize if I worried you.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
I have not been able to face him yet.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Katrina...
The church.
What was that?
Ichabod...
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Did you decide, sir?
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
I want to watch T.V.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
How did your mama die?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Where'd you get them flowers?
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Why?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
It was fun, anyhow.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
What brings you back?
That boy wants me to.
Naw, I ain't.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Will that be cash or charge?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Not an easy book.
Do me a favor, will you?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
It's yours?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
How'd you get started?
They're all the same.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Anything good?
So. Are we ready?
Every word.
Did you ever go back to see her?
She probably died.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
What do you mean?
Like what?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
What's this?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
It'll never be finished.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
No thank you.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
You going to sit here all day?
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
And have you mended them?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
What are you talking about?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
So what's the time?
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
Well, if you put it that way...
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
That's where the what comes in.
Here and there. Around.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.
Two or three nights.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
No wonder he was angry.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
I don't know.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Now, Mister Gi...
Happy for him.  And relieved.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Did you say more?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Well, why does it?
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Cigarette?
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
And her farmhouse...?
Is it possible?
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Wanna see my driver's license?
I beg your pardon.
Okay.
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
But suppose he loses?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Yeah - where were you?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
You've flipped your wig!
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
You don't see any blood?
Where are we running, Joe?
You going to call the police?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Men?
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
What are you doing?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
With ME?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What are you doing with my flowers?
WHAT?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Like when?
Sugar?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Good night, Sugar.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
And that's one of them.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
I'm not that sick.
You all right?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
I'll carry the instruments.
What do you think you're doing?
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
His yacht?
Yeah - Josephine.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
We could pass for that.
Yes, I'm holding on.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
I don't like no witnesses.
We got it second-hand.
Tell what?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Rough?
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Why not?
Thanks, honey.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
That must be it.
Which one is yours - the big one?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
The most wonderful thing happened -
One of whom?
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Been waiting long?
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
What's on Thursdays?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
What thing?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
I don't want to bore you.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax.
Good night.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Tomorrow night?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
You know what I love about all this?
I dont think I can go through with this.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Say something. Please.
Does Kat know?
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
I thought you said you were crap.
Ill just check into a hotel.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Hey.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
What is?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
Its hard to explain.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Yeah. You?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
Oh, no. He told you.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
And so you did your job, right?
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
It's cold, Daddy!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
David Lee...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
Mornin', son...
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
You got two shirts on?
Who is they?
Did you see Daddy?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
What's that you carryin'?
Who's Miss Johnson?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Hello, David...
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
How's the weather out there?
Well, let's get to work!
But, Nathan--
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
What... are you?
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Why the fuck not?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Your behind?
Mph rmpmh rm.
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Mom...
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
What?
Look at that!
Hello there, children!!
Viva la Resistance.
Ber dada!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
What's that?
Oh my God...
That's gonna take a long time!
Be careful, dude.
It's so very cold...
That was sweet!
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Thank you, Kenny.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
It's from your mother.
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
What if I just left?
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Getting drunk is no solution.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Anna...
Jesus, come on!
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Oh, thank you.
So...
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
So, what are we waiting for?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Is that clear?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
We don't.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
Taylor?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
Thank you.
So I've been told.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Where's Taylor?
I'm homesick.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
What the hell is that?
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Is it safe for human transport?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
How do you turn this thing off?
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
What's on your mind, Miles?
Buzz Fazeli.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
100 years!
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
We ain't married no more.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Son?
My poor baby!
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
How's that?
Knock-knock.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Where's Junior?
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Yeah.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Get that outta your mouth!
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Uh...over easy.
Business.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Do you talk with your mom?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Nothing.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You told Junior that we did it.
He's dead Sheila.
Why did you come back?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Very good, busyboy.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Fletcher!  Now!
How big is this spacecraft?
Hold on --
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
But you've tested it?
What was that?
Norman, please!  Don't!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
What have you been told so far?
Anything else?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Wait a second --
You think he killed Edmunds?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Going active.
I see it.
It's not sucking, sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Ted, get her away from the door.
Some sort of lead or something.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
We have a library?
Wait a minute.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Norman.
You said something to him, didn't you?
Still clear?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
None of this was here before.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Page 87.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
What's that?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
Doesn't say.
Not believing you.
What is it, Norman?
How do you feel about snakes?
Did you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
He can't manifest.
Yes.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Shut up, Beth --
I promise --
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth!
What is that?  What are you doing?
Get away from me!
Norman?  Where's Norman?
For who?  The fish?
Why are you looking at me like that?
When did it come across?
Where's it coming from?
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
Our answer.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Norman?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Getting anywhere with those?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
She's cracking, Norman.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
What'd you say?
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
What report?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
What was it?
What kind of a crash was it?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
You saw through me?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
Are you sure you don't need it?
What do I do?
What about the princess?
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Here come six more... grid two!
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
This isn't going to work.
I think she's going to be all right.
Get to the ship!
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
No need, everything's under control.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Are you safe?
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Are you alright ?
So what are you doing later ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Or...?
Well, whad'ya know...
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
Where are you going ?
How do you feel about him now ?
She's flying starships !
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
I love you, Carmen.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You talk to Carl ?
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
...I'm sorry.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
What ?
It stinks, you goin.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Way to go, amigo !
You used to dance...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Best in the Fleet !
On whose authority, Corporal ?
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Mister Rasczak ?
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The examination is a normal function.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
Yes.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Departure angle on viewer.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Then you acted properly, of course.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Was he difficult?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
What should you have known?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Not for us?
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Cal...
Then you'll be wet.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
You bringing your new friend?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
I have one, but they lost it.
Well, it had sentimental value.
I quit.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
I...
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
But why the dalmation?
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
<u>How</u>...?
Me?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
What happened?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Thank you.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
But it's absurd.
What's the scene...
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
...he stuck a fishhook in it.
That's right...
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Press still works.
Lookit that, up already.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
I've been thinking.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.

It's Marty on the Coast -
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
The prices are going up.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
No.
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Look.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Will you help me out...?
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
I know that...
...I can't do it, Wally...
What?
And you know what...?
An artist of your caliber...
...yes...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Did she throw up?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Doug, the traffic light...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
He saw the accident...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Hi!
You cool the broad out?
<u>Stop</u>...
It's just a formality.
Pay her off.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
We got the permit.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Yeah?
Mmm.
Do something.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I've got two days to get this house...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Mass hysteria.
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
That happens.  To families.
What's Thursd...
And what do you do wh...
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
This is my house too!
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Great.  Big ears, too?
Uh.  What is it?
In high school.
...your hating me.
But you told us to starve.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Poof!  You're happy now.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
That I do.  Always will.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Mommy's sick, guys.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay.  These are good.
It's not good enough.
And when did that pass?
So we'll...radiate some more?
Something's up wi...
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
It's a huge moment in their life --
Yet another spaghetti night.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
We don't have any coffee.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Okay, I'm undeserving.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
So.  Hopeful.
I really look like shit.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Thanks for coming out.
Ben never mentioned it.
Why didn't I?
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
It's forever you know.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
It's just an assignment.
They're my kids.
What a great surpri...
I needed some time away.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Where you goin'?
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Out! Leave the table!
You heard me: leave the table!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
You know...Stanley...
No prob. I'm cool.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
But really, you never know.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
This is definitely better.
We used pull.
Sure!...
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
So? How was school today?
Scooby?
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
No.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
I do.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Whoopee.
Prnceton.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Let's move it we got company!
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Now what?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Well?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
What about Cooper--where is he?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Yes?
Give that back to me.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
What are you talking about, Major?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Well, Mister President.
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
You aren't sure!
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
How much soda, sir.
I see.
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Do you think we'd cheat?
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
How long will it take to receive them all?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Then this is it.
War.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
Check target approach.
Release first safety.
What happened?
Where'd they get you?
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Are you sure?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
We are?
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Can I have some?
How long were you in there?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Uh-huh.
Uh, home, you know.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
A cloud.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Stuck with what guy?
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
That sounds so depressing.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No. Life is too short.
Sure.
Yeah, man.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Your his publicist?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Buff.
You better! Yes!
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
No, but I heard it was great.
Whoa!
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
What's up guys?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Erica.
I know. It's okay.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Uh-huh.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
What? What'd you do?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
This is my home.
Why we're just standing here.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Your sure as hell right about that.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Yes, you asshole.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It got that close.
Okay, what would you have done.
Jeff. Jeff.
What?
What feelings?
Come with me.
So what do you wanna do?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
What?
Mm-hm.
Where are you going?
I've run out of words.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Go.
Yeah.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Really?
Now?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Hey, where's Erica?
Look, get down off my property.
Get off my property!
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
I hope you're happy!
No, this has everything to do with you.
Yeah?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah?
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I'm moving.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Is that Jeff?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yeah?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
I'm going out later.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Hello?
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Hi, Jack.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
Oh... What are you working on?
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Kansas!
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Oh no...
Hello?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Name dropper.
If I could be of any help...
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I had a teacher like that once.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
What has Artie to do with it.
It's just impossible.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
May I say you smell real special.
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
What happened?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Gordon Cole?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Of course it is.
I will not have it butchered.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
It's getting kind of late --
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
What scene?
Cut away from me?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Don't bend back like that.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Keep it.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Did she read the script?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
That's what I told them.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
What's the matter, Max?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
How's that about your being my friend?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
What is the scene? Where am I?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
What does it mean?
A Storm Dragon?
Home?
At last. Ultimate Power.
Western Europe.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Like it?
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
We can't do that.
We're from different worlds.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
Away. From you.
You think so?
Finished your estimate?
What is it?
Oh no, not you again.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Hey, where you going?
Can I give you a lift?
Someone's chasing him.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
What's a tree?
Where is Earth?
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Your hair looks the same.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Don't you believe in knocking?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Who are you ?
Where is inner space?
There is a way.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Not enough vodka in it.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
You look wonderful.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
I just can't stand this.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
I can never get a way from it.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this blackmail?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
So?
He's the only one who can operate this --
Are you okay?
Lois, what are you doing?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
A "complimentary corsage."
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Who ????
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Oh Clark, no!
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Lois, someday --
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
Mush!  Mush!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
He flies as well, then . . .
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
What more?
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
No Paris?
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Awesome!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
I think he's kind of cute.
What's he going to say?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
He's . . . cold. . .
We'll all fry.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Me?
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Do you know where you're headed?
Not...gray.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
So I've noticed.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Damn!  This will get him.
Mr. Romance...
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
What do you suggest, my dear?
No news is not good news. Y'know
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Then -
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Who...who...
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Well...flashlight?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
What's the matter, Otis?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
I still don't get it.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
So there were others?
What happened?
I understand.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
So what brings you out tonight?
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
You're leaving.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
I have to.
Because I have to.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Why did you do that, Billy?
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
He knows that?  Billy?
You've talked to Billy?
You heard what Abbott said?
It's for the school bazaar.
Away from your crazy Mom.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Nicole?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Nicole?
That's right.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
Dolores.
It was snowing.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Have they ever been busted?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
DADDY!!!
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Yes.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
You could see the speedometer?
There wasn't time?
What do you remember about the accident?
You're going to blow everyone away.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
How do you like it, Nicole?
Pretty slick, eh?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Will you mind your own business!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Come on boys, break it up...
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Is it news to you?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Why are you trembling, dear...?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
He means that much to you...?
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Sidney, I told you -
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah!
What would you think of me if -
That's the third time he's called today.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
You're talking very fast.
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
I tried to reach you twice -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
I can't
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
You sure?
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Alriight!!  My man!
I'll deal with the police.
Mom?  You okay?
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Can it be destroyed?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
It's finally over.
On Furtwängler.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
What's that mean?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
You live here, in Berlin?
Steve.
Think you can get me any of that?
I'm sorry.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Of course.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Steve Arnold...
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Who warned you?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Yes, I know who he is.
That's an outrageous lie!
I'm sorry.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Okay, so what is it?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Yes, you remember.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
What?
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
I've remembered something else...
One of your people told me.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Can you handle it?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Great.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
You must have a girlfriend.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Is this enough?
Not possible.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Give me the short version.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Same shit.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Did you play recently?
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
There's got to be a flashlight.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
Where are we going?
Nice.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Want anything to drink?
They're watching.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Then, what good are you?
I don't know.  A lot.
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
Where'd you get that... ?
It's mine...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
No.
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
But, will you?
What's this all about, Connie?
Who?
How do you mean, exactly?
Slow down, take a breath...
What?
Split it?
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
It's different every time.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Where?
Guess!
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
Is everything alright?
What makes you ask?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
What's this about?
The Hinchberger wedding.
Your ex-wife.
What?
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
I wasn't expecting you.
Attractive...
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
It's not going to hold your weight.
It's still an electric shock!
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
It was a stupid thing to do.
I don't know.
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
What happened?
Maybe they're Mary's.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Oh God, we can't get out!
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
How could he have left without his keys?
I've never had a pedicure before.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Italian.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
What kind?
Our black friends?
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
What more is there.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Do you have any friends, man?
What d'you say, Elaine?
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Oh, it just ended, then.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
-- Your employer?
What line is he in.
I bet.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Where's Big Sur?
Fancy it?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Yeah, I guess you are.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah, that's right.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
I don't get it.
So why would he want to see you.
Where is he, then?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Ann--
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Hello, Rachel.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Ah yes, a music lover.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
...Was that a pass?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
Uh-huh.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Oh, Jesus.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
Where you going?
...What a knucklehead.
Dave.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
OK, how did you know?
How did you get into the store?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
I'm fine.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Ed, how're you holding up?
That was quite something.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
...How you today, Ed?
You don't got a headache?
...We goin'?
Doesn't bother me.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
How big is the sub-basement?
I smell it.  It's here.
This place is a maze.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
What happened?!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
What's that?
What does it say?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
What are we talking about here?
Curious.  There's something missing.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
What is it?
Like the claw.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Something tried to get into this room!
Where is that?
What's that?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Not that big.
They've got something.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
What?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
What happened?
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Is there another way around?
Then it won't go after the others?
For what?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
It's the busy season.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
You want to book the flight?
We're not watching the sea.
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
The creator of what?
The memory of who?
You take Japanese.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
Well, what do you think?
I know.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
How's your hip?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
You got it.
They're coming.  Any minute.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
How's it going, Truman?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Not supposed to talk about it.
Well, we're FBI agents.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Who called this meeting?
Do they know?
I'm looking for him.
Have you examined them?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
How's that?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
You found something?
What?
-- You saw this experiment?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
What kind of infection?
What did you find?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you think it is?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
What? What's wrong?
I can't go any farther.
We're going to the morgue.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Well, call General McAddie.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Agent Mulder --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Where's Scully?
Is she alive?
Let me out. Stop the car.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
She adores you.
Miriam...
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
...give a kiss to Edward.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
Wait...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
They're hungry.
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Intravenous administration complete.
Catherine!
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Any psychiatric medication?
Is she alright?
Agent Novak.
That's a secret.
So?
Here he is.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Den leuten.
You were awfully good.
His own doctor?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Who are you looking for now?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
...quarrel?
That's the reason.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Must you take those?
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
How will I know you?
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
See much of him before that?
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
A parrot bit me.
So would I.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
Calloway!
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Wait a minute - let me out.
...excuse me.
Do you know his number?
You do!
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Come upstairs a moment.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...this way.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
...you.
Not yet.
Find out?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Kurtz.
The Roumanian?
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Yes, it is.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
No.
Should I make it all fact?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
I'll share something with you.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Everyone ok?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
They only kill them when they love them?
What's a fascist?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
You coming?
What do you care?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
How come you know all this shit?
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Who's Linda?
Your father??
What's it about?
Fuck that.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
Is it okay if I record this?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Balint?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
What are you doing here?
Tell it to Hitler.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Isn't it true?
Get out of here....
This will be a different kind of device.
That's all we've got left.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
You remember Miriam....
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
How?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Do you think I...
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
What do you mean?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Are you going to keep it?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Did the driver really freeze?
What's happened??
It can't be true!
You're right.  You're fired.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Where did you two meet?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
The Mamma's there too.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Checking out the competition.
How do you know that?
How did it happen?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Yes?
Is he here?
... What's your name again?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Why?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Enzo?
Your mother?
Madame...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Can I come in?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
That's good.
I'm concentrating.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
... Push me back in the water...
Don't you have a heater?
Tea... or whiskey?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
How can you tell it's a female?
Then, tell me a story.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Jacques...?
Why?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
... And those?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Who... Who is that?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
So, now what?
What!?
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Okay, what's the information?
How do we bypass it?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What should I charge?
So, how was I?
Mmmyes.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Sure, I like my leopards
I want him to lock me up.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
He will be waiting...
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
Why?
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
To the eye? Like other men.
It was you, Galbraith!
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
What are you getting at?
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
That's easy. Me.
No  not yet.
Clo-Clo?
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
Who is he?
I can use them.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
We stood here once before.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I found this at your brothers.
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Where is that?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
And who does Friedman work for?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
You sure you passed on my message?
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
What if it is?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Problems?
Lets go.
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Maybe I dont.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Trying to say something, Martin?
What are you talking about?
Five to three. Youre early.
Your lady friend did.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Fine...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.
What about which girlfriend?
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
What do you think?
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I would like some fresh straw.
And I would like to see a priest.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I thought you were an archer?
What did they say?
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
Do as I say!
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
No...
Go onto the next question.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
W-w-what are you doing?!
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
Thanks be to God.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Your majesty, I really think you...
... as always, majesty...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Does he have hair?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
This is no good!
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Besides, what about these...?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
We... won?!
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
What have you done to me?
Who... who are you...?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
What are you doing out here?
I... I never lied!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Why were you yelling like that?!
Why would they?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes...
My father's.
Is that bad?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Who is this "he"?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I want to be with him always...
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Really?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
How long have you been married?
Let me see this.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
What's happened?
Calm down, what, what is it?
I've no money.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
And suppose they take the table away?
You know what we do? We use psychology.
You sell anything?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Pig!
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What's happening?
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I worry for you.
She looks tired.
What for?
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, words. You have never heard words?
You have to wash them.
Everyone has to practice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
She wants it to come.
Play a gig.
Mama.
You the owner here?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
There's always a depression on.
I thought you blew all your money.
They're still looking for him.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
I'll take him anyway.
No signs of trouble?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
How ya doin'?
See and raise five.
She coulda killed me last night.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
It isn't any better.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Looks like he missed ya.
Hooker!
So could Shaw.
You're dreamin', kid.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
No.
What happened?
You want a drink or something?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
You got nothin' on me.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What's your next step, Nick?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
Why did that man want to kill him?
How are you?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
You know, we know each other.
How did you ever remember me?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
This is my wedding.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
You can take that out to the car.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Nothing.
Not without a warrant.
What about the suicide?
No proof?
What about Jorgensen?
Well, what'd you think?
Who're you calling?
Could this be him?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Well....
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Good morning --
But he's interested!
I know.
Chris!
We're just having a little drink.
I don't like him.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
That's my business.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I can't! I haven't got it!
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
But what if you need more money?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
I've never heard about you.
All right - you didn't.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
What's that?
Why do you say that?
So it's you he was after!
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
You might have mentioned me first.
What hit me?
What are you going to do with it?
Finished with these?
Aren't you hot in that?
Is that another Christmas present?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Back to California
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Well, don't they?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Yes!
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
I hope you're well.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
You worked here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Nick Charles here?
I'm sorry...  but...
Where are you going?
What's it say?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
What?
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
There's nothing we can do.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about it?
You're out of your mind.
Then step aside.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Just keep quiet.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Steady it out!
She okay?
You can't tell anybody about this.
It'd make their heads explode.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
You didn't step on any mine.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
How's this going to work?
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Think there might be more Iraqis?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Get up and dig.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
What the hell took so long.
What if he's not?
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
I don't want to die.
Getting cold.
What do you figure it is?
What did you say?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
Well?
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
What does that mean?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What is this?
That's in two days.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
If there's gold.  If!
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
I thought we were dead.
We have to go back.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
It's got a bottom.
What the hell are you doing!?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Stress category.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
HUMMMM.....
Hurry up.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
I'm not hungry.
What did you get?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Look, food!
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
They're watching us now.
Good Lord!
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
Well?
Where's LUH?
I'm leaving.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
She's not there
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Coffee, Mike?
What're you talking about?
What was-? Why...?
Now wait just a fucking-
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
This is where the van was parked.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
How long are we going to stay?
So cut both.
Which one's which?
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
How do you know?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
Whadaya mean?
You got it.
Computer device?
Alright!
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
What is that?
Drop it.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Pooch, can you move it?
Oh shit...
Next week we work the park.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Nice to be here.
It's our only option.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
What did you talk about?
No.
And harems ... ?
Nice day, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
And as for you, waiter--
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Yes, m'sieu.
Very well, m'sieu.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head.
The pepper, too?
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Five, seven, and nine--
Yes...?
You like that statue?
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
Then a little nap--
Good night.
Precisely.
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Thirty-three--
Mariette!
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Two lumps, madame?
About what?
I think you'd better go.
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
No--I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
You're certain?
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
You told me to change.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Is this in any way unclear?
No thanks. I'm heading back.
How you two doin'?
The boats are all going.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
Why have we stopped?
No you won't.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Jack, must you go?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Where to, Miss?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Now it's worse.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
You have to go for help.
Will this work?
You jump, I jump, right?
Yes sir.
April 14, 1912.
Is your stateroom alright?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Rose, get in the boat!
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Feeling a little better, I see.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
You'll excuse me.
Like her paint job?
Where have you been hiding?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
I could see you were pining away--
Who with?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
We coulda got two third-class!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
You don't think--?
A dollar forty.
My change.
Inspector McKinney.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
About sixteen hundred.
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
It's your deal.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Am I a member of this club?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Yes.
What's the matter, Mary?
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
He's certainly good-natured.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I'm all right.
I was in his cabin--
Ain't got time.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
God damn son of a...
Oh, my God...
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Where'd you get that horse?
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
On three?  You call it.
Here, Doc.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
So what does he want?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Don't touch me!
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
What is it?
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
And I don't even know your full name.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Come up to the fire, honey.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Really?  You sure?
Well hello, Sherm.
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Well how do we look?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
It's that woman from the coach!
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Get down, boy.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
I just got it fixed.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
We should get moving.
Look pretty rough.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Q! How are you?
Yes -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Sidney Winch, meet -
... Kids?
Have we met?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
If I were you -
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
... What's Harmsway done?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
What do you make of all this?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Sakwa!
Who's in charge here?
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Please sir. Please -
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Will it go off?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
You okay?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
I'm worn out.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
Good morning.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
How is everybody?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
How is he doing?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
How many people do you all feed?
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
Did you have your child at home?
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Yeah!
Can I bring some toys?
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
We're almost there.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes, I can.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
What happened to you?
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Ha-ha!!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Hey!!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
ROOAAAARR!!!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
I got it, Woody!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
There.
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Reach for the sky!!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
You'll put your clothes here.
He's a pyjama case, really.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
I want to go home.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
You're only a young thing.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
What?  What is it?
Why does he need money?
How much?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
Helena --
Did you get it?
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
This is different.
How long have you known?
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Oh, it is?
Where are you going?
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
You all right?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Parents still together?
You do?  What else you do?
Yes, mom --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
You may speak.
They're going to walk right past me.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What is the name of your informant?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
It's a scandal, Franco.
What?
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Diane.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
What?
I don't see why not.
Holding hands?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Screenwriter?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
Yeah.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
God, you're sick.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
I can't believe you did that.
It was my fucking television.
How much?
But you don't have the money?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
What's on the menu this evening?
Sounds great, Swanney.
It's fresh air.
How long is it?
What do you see as your main strengths?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
Your pain runs deep.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
What are you doing?
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Life is not a dream.
Goodnight, Spock.
Not General Korrd.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
...mark two.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
We must change our course at once.
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
No special conditions?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?

I don't get it.
My dinner.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Did you say Group 7 access?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Come on in...
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
Yes!
Flynn?
Cute.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Dumont!
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Flynn!!
You're alive!
Then...
A User -- in our world?
Flynn... you can't... I
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
So...how's the world of serious science?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
What do you think?
Do you know what he's talking about?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
My quarters.
What is it?
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Son of a bitch!
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Station wagon?
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Guy's a spook!
She could be telling the truth.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
My husband is a good man.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
Yes.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They said you had to run out.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Why did you continue to see him?
Not because you were attracted to him?
Would you say he was boring, then?
What?
I think so.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
What were you doing there?
Is it working yet?
17 years.
As much as you used to?
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Who's your little friend?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
What is it you want me to do?
You'll call me then?
What's happened?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Gotten your mail yet?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Bye-bye.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Great movie. Action-packed!
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
'Bout twelve.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Like it?
Four hundred bucks.
What's that?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Who?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
I do.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Was it him or you?
Is this a joke?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
What?
Yeah.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Who the fuck are you?
Wannabee nigger...
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Clarence sent a letter?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
Clarence.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
What do you think, eightball?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Say it, goddamn it!
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I'm really not very -
What do you want from me?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I don't believe you.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
That was very good.
Where'd he come from?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
What was I sayin'?
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You gotta hold this for me.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Sorta room-mates?
Yes.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
Him?  You saw that man?
I understand.  There'd be no point.
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
They're keeping an eye on me.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
We need gas.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
You smell so good.
The gun! ... I lost it
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Uh, that message...me?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
He was fully sedated!
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Nine thirty
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
He no!
I think I've heard that before.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
You want somethin'?
Nope.  Darrell.
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
No!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Maybe I don't want you to.
It's Grace.
Wasn't nothing.
Yes, I have.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Where you coming from?
Where you headed?
Nice place you got here.
A medicine man?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
I'm guessing no.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is it pretty?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
What are you talking about?
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
If you want.
To get my car.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
He was going to take the money.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
It's . . . it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Hey!
Hungry?
Nice office you've got.
Talk?  About what?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
You meant it.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
What should I do?
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
You think that's a lot of money?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
It's the truth, Jake.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
What are you babbling about?
Two-hundred dollars.
I asked you a question.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Nooo!
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Kids.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Got any cold soda?
I call the policia.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
What?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Christ, I don't believe this!
Say, what happened to your hand?
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Would you?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
I came for Grace.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Look, Harlin.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
That's right on my way.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Accident.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens when you lose?
What do you do anyway?
A medicine man?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You never did answer my question.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You'd never understand.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I wanted to talk.
I could if I had Jake's money.
The money's right here! Get the key!
I can't see it.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Why's that?
<u>Jake</u>...
Morning, officer.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Heineken?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Who was that on the phone?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
What's the matter?
I axed you a question.
Once again please?
How old is Jeb?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Okay.
Megan?
I remember you.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
...I think rust.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
What's he talking about?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Yes.
Quick.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's kind of a miracle.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
You like sports?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
He doesn't look very threatening.
How are you feeling?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
Is this a religious thing?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
You told them cowboys you had it.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
What'd he say?
He tell you where them others is?
I thought... you was an angel.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
Oh. How long I been here?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
All week?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
I could run off them whores.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Who killed him?
Then... what?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Yeah, I guess so.
He said that, huh?
Jesus!
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Did you kill him?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Better re-load it.
They takin' water?
Yup.
Did... you... get... him?
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
You... gonna take... the money?
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
HEY.
Jesus.
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Easy, Bill.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
That fella come by... Tom.
More.
Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
He's gonna die, ain't he?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
There was ninety-one million -
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
They just said they wanted time.
Come home, Dean.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
I'11 be alright.
How are they going to do it?
We'll make it.
What-are they speaking?
with what?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
When does he post bail?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
No, no, no, no, no.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
I don't know about that.
So this lawyer...
Came from Redfoot.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
No...
I knew him. He would never -
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
You're joking.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
What is the truth?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Thank you.  When Debby...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Objection, we've...
How is that?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
No further questions.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
It's all right, Mickey.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I am seventy-four years old.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Dr. Thompson...?
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Thank you ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Listen to me, fella...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Do you think it's my fault?
Joe...  Joe...
What are you going to do?
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...yeah...good...
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Hi.
Mrs. Simmonds.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
You don't have to do it for a living.
Would you like a drink now?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Ernie's.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
What do you want to know?
About three years.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Will you, Judy?
Ernie's?
Scottie!
I'm scared.
We're going up the tower.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Do you remember where you were?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Good-bye.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How can you be sure?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
And no birds sing.
Where?
No!... No!
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Where?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Where?
Madeleine --
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Oh, yes!
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
What do you mean?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
How's your love life, Midge?
Well?
Easy, now.
The poor thing....
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Out!
What have you been doing?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Can't do what?
I said how's it going?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
You're an asshole Adam.
Name one.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
Don't even start.
Wait!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Wait. Wait a minute.
We have to get going.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
I won't do it.
If anything ever happens to me...
Have you thought about what I said?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
That's right.
I don't think so Boyd.
He's right.
I got her arm.
What's your fucking point?
He just had two.
You said that Boyd.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's cracked up.
Regarding what?
Take care of business.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
My what?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
I don't hate women.
There's my point exactly.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
This is ridiculous.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
You expect more what?
Keith do not trivialize this.
Not padded ones.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Hello.
That's sweet.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I know.
You killed a prostitute.
Call the police.
What?
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
I have no idea.
Greenpeace.
You alright?
Pup corn?
Yeah?
That's a good one.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
"You Send Me."
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Give them to Refugio.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Where's the camera?
Don Amalio!
You have no feelings toward ...
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Yes, it is.
Never.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
How much is that?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
How in hell does it wind up?
You see how much you like her?
Me, rich? Come on!
Kill him.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
And ...your friend?
Is she coming back?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
It's a very big one.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
She looks like a sick marrow!
What happened to me?
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
In English, please.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
What did Cox pull him out early for?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
A little less than yesterday.
I don't need a babysitter.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
What are you doing?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
Nice work.
You okay?
Where the hell are you going?
Where's John?
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
What about it?
No, this is great.
What can it hurt.
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
...this is a snappy song....
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
When do we bring'em back?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We're going to have to explain away the...
What crisis?
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...the...
Yes
What do you know about them?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
...where is the Back End coming from?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
We'll be back tonight.

Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
...I just missed my plane.
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....

As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
Hello...?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Whaddaya think?
Why do they go to War?
Dartmouth
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Trade Re1ations.
Do I know you?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Who?
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
...who is this guy...?
You can't have a war without an enemy.
Three-o-three...
In the Folk Music Section.
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Mmm.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
...what happened...?
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
You can't tell this story.
Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
...what do you got?
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
I have the White House on the Line.
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...as of today, 89% favorable.
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...mmm.
Yup.
Oh, hell...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...if I had your looks, better.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
What the hell...
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Hey the door was open.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
Sell?
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your words, not mine...
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
What if they call him?
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Okay.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what's the problem?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
What about hard work?
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I can't...and I won't.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
He still likes you
Anybody want another drink?
Weird and tiny huh?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Your books Master Loftmore
We're all here, and ready sir!
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
That was very good.
I started seeing things.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Fireball?
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
What?
How?
You think you influenced her?
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
How're you holding up?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Your house is so beautiful.
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No, I don't.
I didn't sleep with him.
She got it.  Turned it down.
How you holding up?
You are?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Absolutely.
Seance.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
What?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Adamant?
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I can't believe this is happening.
I guess not.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
How are you?
It's just us now.
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Yep.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Oh.
Norman...
You don't remember?
You dropped a glass.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
The...
...I'm positive this time...
Your wife...
"You know..."
Claire, please don't...
I never asked you to quit!
I tried to break it off!
Claire...
The leaves...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
I don't believe you.
What?
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:Would you stop it!
There are two.
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Don't tell Rowan about this.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
Who the hel1 -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Parents say he - uh - fell -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Made it...?
I know that you're evil.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
What do you see...?
you're very --- different.
What else did you see- Michael...?
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Doctor's orders- - -?
I'm serious.  You don't -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
You did that, didn't you...?
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Hi.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
I'm getting --- left behind.
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
I heard something like that
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
And it can't be forged?
It doesn't mention 'females only'
What are you doing?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
Tell me about your wife...
then why did you marry her -
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What?
What is it?
Yes...
First finish your tea...
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
What happened?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
ANGEL...
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Hurry.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
You're late, bro!
You'll never believe who's in there.
I thought I loved her.
Never say never.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Well. The prom's coming up.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
God, you are so hot.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
You guys are my parents.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I-I don't have the keys.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
My legacy.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
I miss them, too.
Great.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I guess.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Well? What do you think of her?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Whatever.
And then what?
You're amazing.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That's probably my office.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
You promise you'll finish school?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
You were the new and improved you.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Merritt, Forensics.
You okay?
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
It's our job, Gloria.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
I want a full-scale investigation.
What did you do then?
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Thank you, Jimmy.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
You are.
What are you looking at?
Excuse me?
Get off my property.
Kelly...
How much?
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
Good thinking.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Get away from me.
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Jesus, man... You okay?
Yeah, right.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
You feeling all right?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
At least I tried something.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Willard...
What is that?
And people are actually fooled by that?
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
I know!  I know!
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God!  He's so excessive!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Your private train, sir.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Are you all right?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
I can't.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Thanks for your help, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Smells like a battle.
You gotta promise to feed her.
You!!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
She said lots of thing.s
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Ouch!!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Madmartigan.
Talk!  Say something!
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Nail it!
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Amish.
What have you got?
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
How long?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
You know carpentry?
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I was being foolish?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
I got there late, John.
I'm coming.
You know where he is.
You admit you're lying?
You're the first one he'll contact.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Everything okay?
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
What about Carter?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He's not in this building.
No, you listen. Get out!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
No --
Uhh -- yeah --
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
...have you come back?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Run, Toto, run!
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Are you ready now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
...room --
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Now you're seeing reason.
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
And bears!
Dorothy!
...yes.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'll be home in time for supper!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Does it work?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oil can what?
The other side....
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh, come on now - everybody --
No -- No -- No -- No!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
And you're going to lead us.
That's right.
Up!
Stop pushing!
I haven't slept in weeks.
Dorothy!
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
...of the West.
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out.
No, you don't.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Stop that dog!
You new?
Whos she?
Is there another way?
Weve got to get out.
Old friend?
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Who is it?
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
How long has he been with you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
What is it?
Then take me with you.
Vodka martini.
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
...what?
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
Im coming with you.
Wheres M?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Mother of God.
The Maidens Tower.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Warm.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Hi, Jon.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Would you like me to stay?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I¹m not.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
His what?
Old?
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
They're practically on us . . .
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
What's he doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
I can fix it.
Their real names, please.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
He's a little farther gone every time.
What about you?
New information.
Why is that?
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
Not bad for a gimp.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
How will you fix it?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Whatchu doing here?
What game is that?
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
You do everything Yorgi says?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Where's he headed?
You okay?
What are you doing?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I can see that. Why?
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
That's the guy.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
How long have you been in Alaska?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Let go.
He takes himself seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
The intention of registration act -
What are you going to do?
Now that's Magneto talking.
Where are we going?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
I felt like she almost killed me.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Surprised?
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Goodbye, darling.
Love me?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Vermicelli.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Nineteen, sir.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Are these your bags?
There.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
What are you doing here?
Did you hear that strange music??
What is this place?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Hmm!
That's not bad.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
But you did -- I just heard it.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
No, no!  That whole thing!
All right -- where is she?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Thanks...for all your help.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Would you like a sandwich?
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
A god?
It wasn't me.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Nor to Elizabeth.
I'm getting tired.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Another fifteen seconds to go.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.

Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
Sure have.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
Well, no...
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
The "real you".
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Great
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You are so completely unbalanced.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
What if she never starts dating?
But she doesn't want to date.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
So -- which Dakota you from?
How many people were in your old school?
That girl -- I --
Who is she?
Why not?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What makes you think he'll do it?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
Her favorite uncle
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Where ya goin?
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
A hundred bucks a date.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Who's that?
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
He always look so
What's this?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Have you seen him?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Pick you up Friday, then
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Are you following me?
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
What's this?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
You're not okay.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
Why 're you doing this?
You don't care if I die
Why?
Like you could find one
Dorsey.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
No, you weren't
I should do this.
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Who?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Good call.
A soft side? Who knew?
So what's your excuse?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
You up for it?
State trooper?
The duck?
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No.
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
You tell me.
Answer the question, Patrick
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
My grandmother's .
Wait I...
It wasn't like that.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Why can't we agree on this?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Was that your sister?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Bianca did what?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Macbeth, right?
Say it
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I missed you.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Did I have anything to say about it?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
He's the devil's child...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
May I ask by whom?
My letters of appointment.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
What are you listening to?
What does he say?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
No...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
All I have to do is call the guards.
What do you see?
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
To bring the word of God.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
How did you manage it?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
Father Marchena!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Colon!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
What are you saying?
How long?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
What do you read?
What's he doing?
Where can I meet this man?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You bloody...
You tell that to them!
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Don't say anything.
I'm coming with you.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
...delusions and paranoia.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your mother was blind?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Now I become custody of police department?
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
I can't take you to my place.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
Is he your boyfriend?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
I'll make some for us.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Who did cause and origin?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
I let her take a shower.
No!  Nothing happened.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
What was that, Korfin?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
I'm gonna propose.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Any I.D.?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
You know what that is, right?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
I'll come with you.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
Mind if I ride along with you?
I'll let you know what happens.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
You thirsty?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Why not?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
Yeah.
I'm serious here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
How many victims are up there?
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay, til tonight.
You promise?
Okay.
Thank you.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
How old are your kids?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
Two weeks.
Who is he?
This all you want?
In here, says he wants a million.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
How you erase this?
Get in the bathroom!
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
What is it?
I did.
Why not?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You got that?
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
I can get you a job.
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
We started over, you can too.
Robert...?
You've got a call.
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
I know.
Well, he...
I'm trying to tell you.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
New York.
A cheap hotel.
I'm here for movies.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll take him.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
You okay?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah?  What kind?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
What??
What?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
How was it?
Get outta here!
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
What are you gonna do?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Okay.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
It's about my salary cheques.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
Oh?
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Yes, I thought so.
How?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Well, that's something.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Good morning. How's it going?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two more.
Hal?
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Well, don't worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.

I'm having a party tomorrow.
Are you coming to my party?
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
That's right.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any ideas about the colour?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Thank you.
What do you mean?
I see.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
That's true
That's true.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Five by five, Frank.
Roger.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Yeah?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Pay money?
I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
I'm candy...
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
What's the matter with my place?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
Here you go, baby.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You're gonna help us take him.
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
You got a name, cop?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Yeah?
You're crazy.
Bullshit.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Luther was part of the gang?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
What do you think?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
We eat when I say we eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Last night.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Well?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
There.
Let's go.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
We split 50-50?
Where's the goddamn car?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
What?
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Where's luther?
We missed.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Yeah, I see her.
That was quick.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
It's late, they're closing...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Hey, there she is...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
You okay?
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah...
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Yeah?
What the bell happened?
How did they get away?
Which one pulled the trigger?
What a screw-up.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Billy Bear...
Who are all these?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
You look awful.
Doesn't look like it.
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
What am I wanted for?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Hey, you're right.
I'm all wet.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Call me later.
Thanks for the coffee.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
No wonder you're so popular.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Hello.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
You real down?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Whaddya think?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Hey...
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
We got a lot to talk about.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
When?
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
You want to go outside?
You sure?
How about some ammo?
How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...We're saved!
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...would you like a drink?
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Who are you?
He's a she!
They all like this in your family, father?
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
We have to save the world.
Of course.
What are you doing?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Do you love her?
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
I don't need one.
Uh... at least fifty.
Hello?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...Priest...
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
...What's your name?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Yeah?
Hello?
...Ma???
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
6... 5...
...Hi.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Six to the left. One to the right.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
You know how to fly this thing?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
Is that all?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
To save the world.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
...Shit!
It's my wife.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoulai!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Which one?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan?
Uh...
Here we go again...
You noticed..
Where you going?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Tell me...
Not going to open?
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
The cash man!
It's not?
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Have you identified it?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
This thing solid?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Wait or act.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Am I disturbing you?
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Your clothing reeks of it.
I'm not accusing you...
Okay, I believe you.
How's the detective business?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I love you.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Hello?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
What happened to you?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Tom...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You couldn't?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What are you talking about?
Bullshit.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
You said something about money.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
What's the problem?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Where's that?
Excellent.
What are these for?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Friend of yours?
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Yeah, who's this?
Who is this.
What the fuck are you.. ?
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't ask questions.
Who is Machine?
I want his name.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Do it.
I never killed anyone.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Look, you cocksucker...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
You are a private investigator?
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're making me very angry.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I'm not a cop.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much do you make now?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
... Hello... ?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Where are your parents?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
A daughter.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
You're learning.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Alright, I get the picture.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Who is he?
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's next?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
He's odd.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
You... you need to go to the police.
It won't work like that.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Hello... ?
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
How are you?  Having any luck?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
Yes... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
What was she running from?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Why do you think he did it?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I didn't mean to...
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Are you religious?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
How... how can you say that to me...?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Hello... ?
What are you talking about... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Do you know what happened to her?
What is this?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
No, sir, he is not.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Okay, I'll take it all.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Alice, you think you can leave?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You alright?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
We'll figure it out.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
You've been up all night?
Then you saw him, too?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
I've been working double shifts.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
What the hell was that?
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
I don't get it.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Nice neighborhood.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
What?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I'll tell you later.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Feeling better now?
I gotta get out of here.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
About him?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
There you go.  Love you.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
I'm so sorry, honey...
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
Did everyone call everyone?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
It's okay.
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
You could train someone else.
What is it?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
I don't know.
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
I think you're right.
Yeah?
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Is there any way out of it?
What about down?
Course and speed?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Excuse me, Skipper---
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Now they feel it...down below.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
As we near the Pole...
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
But - what can we accomplish?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
That's a <u>face</u>???
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Always has been.
Who?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
No.
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Chub says you're fired.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Oh.
You heard the news.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
He's on to us!
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
We bought you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
If you get it?
You might not kill it.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Mmm.
I used to play ball.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Double A. New Britain.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
They said.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
This way.
Don't mind if I do.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Like you and Gordon?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
No, I mean whereabouts.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
You stayed away?
On your sleeve.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Sure you did.
Saw him do it?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm fucking out of here.
Open the door, will ya?
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
You know.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
But it's not funny now.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
I just think you used to be bad.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
What then?
It's fun.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Pop?
How about a Big Mac?
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
That's illegal, you know.
You're a policeman.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Huh?
Don't go playing policeman.
You don't want the extra police pay?
What's the hurry?
Huh?
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
Something bugging you?
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
What do I have to do for it?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
The key, Wade.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
It's just...
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
See. Get your boots.
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
I still don't understand --
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
How's she doing?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I'm sorry.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Call me.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Then... I guess you have to.
Oh, Wade.
You've been married twice --
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Strange.
This is nuts.
What happened?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
You're not using it today?
Coffee's perked.
It makes me sad.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Hold on!
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Who are you?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
It don't look right.
Marg!
You talked to Jack?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Rolfe.
Just do it.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
You remember Margie Fogg?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Yeah.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Rolfe.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Who?
No shit.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
What about Margie?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Which is?
Then who shot him?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
I don't know. You tell me.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Mom?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
It's cut.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Put your pilot on.
Got it.
How we doing, Colonel?
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
They aren't answering their hails.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Sir, you threw out page two.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Can we do that?
But they start executing hostages in
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
That's affirmative.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
How?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
And all these rooms here?
*                     Please tell me your name.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Now, or he dies, please.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
My husband is a very courageous man.
Do you have to be so brutal?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Four...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
How did your speech go?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
and if that means negotiating...
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
One.
who can I say is calling?
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Thank you for calling the white House...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
You wanna knock of f?
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Other way around, sir.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
What's the story?
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Did you feel that?
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Elaine.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted!  What are you...?
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine!
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Simon just ejected!
What will happen to him, Ted?
Are you afraid?
Now!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Simon, what's happening?!
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Roger.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
That's not possible.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Request; life support systems check.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Can I hold him?
He's a boy dog.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
He's carrying a bomb.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Captain Oveur?
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You can't go in there!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
You've been hurt.
Do you want to talk about it.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Both pilots!
Surely you can't be serious.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
George Zipp said that?
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
What did he have?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Ted, what are you doing here?
What's the matter?
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Rats! I've lost number three.
But Ted, you're the only...
Ted...
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
We have a visitor.
We'd better get back now.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Airsick?
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Oh, I'd love to.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Yes?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I like my horizons narrow.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
He's not here.  Why ask me?
In there.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
You don't have squat.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
William Harcourt?
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Let's talk Hubley.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing?
What is this?
Get the picture?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Who said that?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Back off, George.
Screw you.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Who is he?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
I believe he is probably lying.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Was.  Divorced.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
Your health...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
I'm going home.
Where'd you get this?!!
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
Please, I must get out here.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Uh, George...

Shit!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
No!  We must do this alone.
What is this?!
Harcourt is dead.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
That where Anderson worked?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, I heard of it.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What kind of test?
Yeah, Sykes?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
How can I go?
What?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Get outta there!
This floor's freezing.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Movement!
Can't lock up...
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Ripley...
You did okay, Bishop.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
I get the picture.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
If I go.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
That the atmosphere processor?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You son of a bitch.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Yes, Hicks?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
The corner!  Ready?
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go!  Let's go!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
They'll get us.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
What's this?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
It's game time.
Locked.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
Looks like it stung him.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Range twenty meters.
Fifteen meters.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
And how are we today?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
What did you say?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Cross my heart.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Yes.  A little girl.
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
I knew you'd come.
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
Can we dream?
Look, I told you...
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Maestro.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Is there a part for me?
How do you know?
Why not?
What's that?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Why?
Did you know? Had you heard?
The marriage!
How was I? Tell me honestly.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Hardly.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
Why what, sir?
Humiliated?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
What is it?
Where?
Now?
Why?
No! No! No!
Where?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Why not?
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Yes.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Yes!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
What's the matter with you?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
There's a young girl to see you.
I don't know.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
What?
You're not going to do this?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Who was that?
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Why not?
Go back to bed.
Excellency!
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Really?
I see.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Originals?
These are originals?
It is miraculous.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Come back tonight.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
What are you doing here?
Why you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
This is not his handwriting.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
How much will you pay him?
Am I interrupting something?
Where's our friend?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
I see that you're expecting.
When, may I ask?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Hey!
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I said play!
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Just one year.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Sire.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Why not?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Do you like this, Salieri?
Your Majesty!
Oh, thank you.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, where?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
And German?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Yes, what about him?
Why are you here?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Do you always live like this?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
It couldn't be better.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
What's that?
Why not?
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Papa, is this your idea?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Not that I've seen.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Why? What has happened?
What medicine?
Is he working?
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
Yes?
That's right.
What?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
What did he say? What did he say?
Well?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Leave that alone!
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What?
No.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
What for?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Mio caro Adone.
Love, Sire!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
How could I not?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Herr Sommer.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Do you have a daughter?
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Ah. Italian?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
I can't say. Really
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
How fortunate.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
Did my work please you?
Yes?
I have come to commission work from you.
A Mass for the dead.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
What happened? Is it over?
Where is your wife?
You mean she's not coming back?
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
I do.
Are you ill?
What?
Shall I answer it?
Who?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Strange!
Confutatis Maledictis.
Yes.
The Fire.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
It couldn't be simpler.
And that's all?
Do you have me?
That's wonderful!
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
Oh? Have I seen it?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Exactly. A dance.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
No, but I'm the best.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Herr Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
What do you want?
About what?
So?
What do you want?
I do not seek forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Well?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All Vienna has heard that.
Is it true?
Do you hear me?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
No, you didn't!
But not his body.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Oh my son, my poor son!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You mean that play?
He's setting that play to music?
Are you absolutely sure?
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
What anger?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, promise then.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
Can we come in?
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
What exactly did he call out?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Did he say a wolf?
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
He's not?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Yes.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
And what else?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Surely you're not suggesting...
Dr. Hirsch?
What shall we do?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
No, why?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Shall I send a car?
What shall we do?
It was a wolf.
Mr. Kessler?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me David.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I was. What are you reading?
Do you like it?
What do you dream about?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
How old are you?
I'm twenty-seven.
My best friend. My very best friend.
Yes, go on.
Hello. You all right?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
That's easy enough.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
What?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Are you better now?
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
The kitchen.
Closet.
Bathroom.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
But, David.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
The next corner we can get a cab.
But...
David, what are you doing?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Hello, Benjamin.
No what?
Feeling better?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No what?
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
I think he's a Jew.
Miss Price.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
All right, you two, move along.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Now see here young man.
Who is this girl?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
You're in a hospital in London.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
Two weeks?
Lunatic?
There were witnesses?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Yes.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
You're not having a good time are you?
Well, I like it here.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
That's a wolf's head.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Okay.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
What about it?
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
What the hell was that all about?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Say, David...
Could be a lot of things.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe.
No, but he was on the moors.
Come on, where?
What's the plan?
It's in front of us.
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Jack?
Where are we going?
You really scared me, you shithead.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I'm going completely crazy.
What?!
I'm not listening!
Shut up, you zombie!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
It's you, David.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Get out of here, Jack!
A monster. I know, I know.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Hi, Jack.
You look awful.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
No, thank you, Doctor.
You were saying?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Yes?
Excuse me.  Yes?
What's that?
Do you have any hot soup?
Hot chocolate?
Then you have some hot tea?
Oh.
No, thank you.
Sorry.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
I don't rightly know, sir.
Hello, Tom.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
No kidding?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Yeah.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Let me have ten bucks?
Charlie!
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Whose death?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Where you been?
What's the matter, Charlie?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
And tell him not to delay.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
What good will that do?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Fifty thousand dollars!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
That don't do us any good.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Me?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why are you so anxious?
What?
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Why, Matt!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse me
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
The theatre?
Yes, of course.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning.
I don't know.
Why - well, I
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Oh!
Yes?
Yes?
Helen!
Got my letter?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
It's all right. Thanks.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Well, I
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
No. I won't.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
Why pick on him ?
What time did this thing happen?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
You're lying!
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The lobby's half filled now.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
He's at a board meeting.
I'm afraid so.
No.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hello, Helen!
Why?
What did you do with it?
The ten dollars.
No.
Yes.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Well . . . ?
In Cluett's office?
What's keeping you?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
They must have turned him down.
Did you talk to him?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
What did you find out, Mike?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
No. It wasn't earlier because...
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
So you were home last night?
What time did you get in?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Everybody in?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
You can ride like that?
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
We got a problem here, brother?
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
This is the best score yet.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
How'd they --
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
I swear --
I'm sorry, Cole.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Damn!
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
You have no shame.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Beg pardon?
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's planning a job.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
What you sayin' boy?
How?
You shut up now, boy.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Not now.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
Thanks for the help.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
The James-Younger Gang.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
It's not a bank.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Jesse, we got to have a word.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
What are you saying?
Beautiful.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Dammit!
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Missed you, cousin.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
What the --
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Another dozen out back.
The safe. Now.
What?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Of St. Louis?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Then why can't I go in there?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Web died fighting?
Boys...
What do you say, sir?
Daddy, don't start with this again.
They're gone. What are you --
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Such as?
That would have made an impression.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Web's dead.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
That just might work.
"Big and older"?
You are a charmer.
She's still talking to Jesus.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
And we're good at it.
You've killed your fair share of men.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
We're doing this for Ma.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
We're drunk.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Can't argue that.
Uncle Frank?
Did you kill Yankees?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Easterners.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You shouldn't be up.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Not if I find the right girl.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Little ones.
Yep.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Zee.
I don't understand.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I beg your pardon?
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Don't turn around.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Don't swear.
Tennessee?
We're moving you tomorrow.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You almost ended my career before it began.
Mmm.
Yes?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Was it worth it?
That's what I would have done.
You cocky little bastard.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Now let's have a drink.
And you're too young.
I like that.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
... too young for whisky...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Why, yeah.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
Not at all.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
How can that be?
There's only four of them...
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Good.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Just perfect.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Your men knew the risks.
Parker.
What is that?
This is him.
How did you know?
I want them arrested and hanged!
This is no game.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
So he's won.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
I know. Stop it.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I can't.
Dorsia's nice.
You like it there, don't you?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
J&B. Straight.
Are we here?
This is Dorsia?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Luis is a despicable twit.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Why?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Patrick?
I haven't seen you around here.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Really?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
He's rich.
He's good-looking.
He has a great body
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I want a firm commitment.
Why? What's wrong?
We need to talk.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're inhuman.
Where are you going?
But where?
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Because he dated her.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
I think you should go now.
Don't come back.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Carnes? Wait.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
It looks so soft.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
That's Paul Owen.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
SHUT UP!
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia, yes?
I said we are totally booked.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Late?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
After six.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Yes?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
You don't like this, I take it?
What is it?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Who?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Anywhere you want?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Interesting.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Forget it.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
...to the office this afternoon.
Just...say...no!
A model? An actor?
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
She's my...cousin.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Don't tell him you're here.
Who?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
KIMBALL.
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Understandable.  Lime?
How old are you?
Where did you go to school?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
You sure?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How well did you know him?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Do you feel that way?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
He had a yacht?
Don't you know this?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
So was I.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Actually, yes.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Have you consulted a psychic?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Nothing.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
What?
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
Yes.
He does? You're sure?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I'm so hungry.
I'm so hungry.
I lost my job...
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Listen, what's your name?
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Hey, Halberstam?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You think so?
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
Is it over?
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I'm just screwed.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
It's important.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
...But?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That took some fun out of --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What!
What're you -- what?
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Great!
You look beautiful.
...What?
Milo?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
Right. Wait. A toast.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
That'll be a test, won't it?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Milo?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
You're living here?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
What?
Okay.
What?!
Is it your software?
What?!
...When did you know?
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Milo? I'm Danny.
We could move 'em up here.
Who's that?
...Hello?
Cool!
You know a lot about art, I guess.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
How's it going?
It's okay. Really.
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
You really wrote this just today?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Gary, hi.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
What'd the girl say?
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Longitude 109 --
What?
Gary?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Just thought his work should go on.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
...You wanna work -- here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Every entry was authorized.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Lisa.
You know mine.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
...Were you?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Did I say something?
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
He's out of prison?
...Milo?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
What about the FBI?
Who can we trust?
Do we post it on the Net?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
Time?
How close are you?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
Why were you so careless?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I told Teddy about you.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Does he know you know?
Why?!
Please don't go.
Meet me at the other location.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Bring it to the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...He knows.
...You got my E-mail?
Is that how Larry feels?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Did you tell Alice?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
What is it?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
Who're these guys?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
You seem surprised to see me.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
Come in.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Care for some saki?
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
To my health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Thank you.
Where am I?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Oh, and Austin...
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
She's working on another lead right now.
Yes?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Excuse me?
Carnies.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
That does not compute.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
My meat and two veg.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why did you leave so soon?
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Let's go get him!
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I don't get it.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Fancy a nibble?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
Really, Austin!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Not in the Nineties.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Hello, luv.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Who?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
What do we do now?
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'll hurry back.
Austin, what's your point?
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Everything seems to be in order.
Don't mind if I do.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Oh my God, he's back.
Shut up.
Commander, I have to log it...
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We've got a lot of work to do.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Quite impressive.
What is it now?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Right.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil vet?
An evil petting zoo?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
What did you say?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
What about his teeth?
I just don't see it.
Did you ever want to?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
And how do you feel about that?
We don't label people here, Scott.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Really?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Red ...
Knight ...
... death ...
Flower ...
Nature ...
Secret ...
Fear ...
How long have I been here?
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
You
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
May I help you, madam ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Then you can't come in.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
People, too.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
I resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
Who?
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
You.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
An unholy trinity ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
Such as?
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
My father always wanted a boy.
Do you?
I thought we were on our way.
Steed, we really must be --
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
And I suppose you're the knight.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
No thanks.
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Strange.
I wasn't about to.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
I must say, you look more your old self --
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
What on earth?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
Not quite. This is my field.
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Do you always drive this fast?
This must be the last straw.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
Where am I?
Was I?
You followed me.
To kill me?
I could save you the trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
Yes ... ?
And do you trust me?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
But you did suspect me.
I thought you played by the rules.
I'm playing to win.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Aren't you coming?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What's that you're wearing?
What is it?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Where's Mother?
You don't believe him?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Privately owned by ...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Oh, hello ...
Steed
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
Amnesia?
Why?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
This man -- did you see him?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
You with Mother or Father?
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
No, please! I beg you ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
John Steed.
The last one you'll ever see.
You're better than I expected.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Rules are made to be broken.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
What's happening?
Does Cole know about this?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
What do you mean?
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
What is your name?
Who are you?

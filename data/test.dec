Well, there's someone I think might be --
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
I was?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
No
No.
Is he oily or dry?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You did what?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just you.
And where're you going?
Daddy, no!
Why?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people go here?
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Yeah -- we'll see.
Sure
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
You get the girl.
Not at all
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I'm on it
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Just a little.
That's never been proven
I didn't have a choice.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Who?
Maybe.
You 're so --
Unwelcome.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
How?
You know what I mean
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Because I like to torture you.
Enough!
So what I want doesn't matter?
No, Daddy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Oh yeah.
Yeah...
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Good enough.
Just for now.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Dr. Ruth?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
You don't usually ask.
Yes... I remember...
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
Chief says...
You did the same to your God!
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Damn God!
Colon!  Don't!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
A woman?
Thank you.
My horse doesn't work.
And what do you think Mendez?
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
The land is there.  I know it!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
No.  No way.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
Pouring it out!
Daphne, I...
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Yeah, right.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
No.  I'm okay.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Watch the news?
Nah, why should you?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
You're Polish?
My point exactly.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Answer it.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Jesus Christ.
I'm not moody.
Not what.  Who.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
I am butcher.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
I have five-hundred dollars.
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Good idea!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Milos.  Get my money!
Ha. Ha.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Excuse me?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Yeah?
How long they been livin' here?
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Yes.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Yes, very pleasant.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I will if I can, Frank.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Hammond.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Goodbye.
I got a lot to protect.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Jesus.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
What about Ganz?
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Yeah.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Hiya, kid.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
How would you know?
Can't complain.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Not bad, not bad.
Napoleon... small.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
They are robots!
So you do know her.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
What kind of mission?
When is she not in trouble?
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Yes. Of course..
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
How many points you got left on your license?
Yes ma..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Crystal.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I don't think this is a good time...
Got it...
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
I've had enough good news for today
Why not?
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Exactly.
Because...
Uh..
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Options.
To fame.. salud..
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Got it.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
There's nothing harder.
What you see is what I got, mister.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Dino...
Hmm.
Is it?
I'll consider it.
We can do that.
I'd rather you didn't.
Right here.
I remember him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Move it, dirtbag... !
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
I'm not so sure about this.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Eddie.
I know what you did.
What do you want?
Yeah.
You enjoy it?
What did you do with her body?
Easy enough for you.
Of what sort?
I'm asking.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Yeah... guess so.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Three, four years.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Child pornography.
Twenty-five.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Thank you.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
No.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
The checks were for odd amounts...
You're joking.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Neil... Neil Cole.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
We're all like that.
I don't know.  I think so.
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
None too discreet, is he?
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
It was bad.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
We have matching luggage.
You're his sister, right?
Kristen's story really got to her.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Save it for later.  Come on!
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
You're not taking my baby!
She doesn't want me around
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Yeah...I guess.
Sobering...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark!
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Faint.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Yes?
But if they <u>do</u>?
So they caught up with you, too?
Huh?
'Us?'
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Right, Skipper.
Something wrong?
Wonderful!
What about time...?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
What direction does the system indicate?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
That's what I said!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Thank you.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Shit.
What blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
To us it was.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yes.
It belongs to Pop.
No.
Fuck you.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Forget it.
Yeah. I mean that.
Good.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
How?
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
This town sucks.
Jack?
Where... how'd you hear that?
She's coming.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
That's what you think.
For what?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sorry, honey.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
You read my mind.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Because it is my duty.
Roger.
Copy, Air Force One.
Thank you.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Over my dead body.
Good. Good.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Can't it wait?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
White House Situation room.
We're handling it, sir.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
I might still have a few chips left.
I just wish it was that simple.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I was reading too.
You better check it, Unger.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Set!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Simon.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Don't be too long.
Roger.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
Go ahead.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
No. I'm all alone.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Uh-huh.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Huh?
Yes?
No. No thank you.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Here?
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Yes.
And still it fits?
Did you learn anything?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
Why?
Thank you.
Nothing.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We all did.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
No... two.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
The human?
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Hear me out...
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
...We're coming in.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Let's get these things lit.
On my way.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
We didn't miss anything.
You're just reading me.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Why not?
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did you ever have a baby?
Wah...?  Where are...?
Look!
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Certainly!
Indeed.
In a harem.
A Turkish brothel.
Perhaps.
You might be disappointed.
Extremely clever.
Don't bother!
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
What??
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Sir -
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
I'm not telling you.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
What for?
He asked me to stay.
Leave him alone!
He's doing his best.
Behold!
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Ah-ha!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
And the result satisfies.
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Thank you, Sire!
Yes, Sire.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Well. There it is.
I will.
Don't you have a maid?
How many?
This is just a game, Papa.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Do any pupils come to the house?
In there, sir.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Can I see it?
Well, we can.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Really?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Who are you?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Yes.
Also identical?
Exactly.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
On the contrary.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Here in Vienna.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Yes?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
What? Who the devil are you?
Who is she?
Yes, I am looking after him.
Of course.
Bene.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
David?
I beg your pardon?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
How is that?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Will you think about it?
Not just a patient -- me.
A werewolf?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
There is only one bed.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
What?
Will you shut up!?!!
No.
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
You did, did you?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Oh, come on, tell us.
I was having a nightmare.
Alex?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David.
You ask them.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
I heard that.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Yeah.
I don't know. Come on.
It's circling us.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
What do you think?
You don't have to say anything.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
What about the zoo?
I want you to meet some people.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
I beg your pardon?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
We'll find him, not to worry.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Yes - sure
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Matt?
Yeah.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Just pure luck!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
What about?
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
You understand?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
I want to be near you!
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
Now?
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Tomorrow night?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
No, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Yes, sir.
Don't you think I know it?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Oh, is that so?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
I tell you, I saw them!
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Mr. Williams . . .
Yes, why?
He was here?
There you are!
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
I don't know.
Yes.
Okay, Matt.
I'm okay, Matt.
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Never a good thing.
That was two hours ago.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Tomorrow.
Two.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Hey!
I could use the walk.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I got us through the War all right.
That's it.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
You ride like a Comanche.
Which one, right or left?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Ho-yah!
Me get heap firewater --
What is it?
I had you covered.  From back there.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
So we got a plan?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Heard of him.
Bob's upset.
Jim was old enough...
Yeah.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Everything but the boring parts.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
"Hmm" what?
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
Last February?
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
You been with a girl ever?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
I look forward to seeing it.
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
It is a nice piece of writing.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Can't you tell me anything?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
I'm ignoring you.
Take it off.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Is your Evian spiked?
No-I can't take the time off work.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Patrick?
New card. What do you think?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Oh really? That's great.
When?
Just...say...no.
Yes, sir.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Yes, Patrick?
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
No, not really.
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
What do you think I do?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
No. I'm okay.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Shoot.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
I know. I'm sorry.
No, I guess it's okay.
Hang...out?
Oh.
What?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Eerie. Really eerie.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
But Marcus denied it?
Where was Marcus?
I'm so hungry.
I'm hungry
I'm hungry.
Al.
I've been great. And you?
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Yes, it is.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
I can paint anywhere.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Nothing.
Guilt?
...Different?
What?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Prick.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
Gimme the coordinates?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You do?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Cool.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
You're compulsive.
Why would you do a thing like --
The Day Care?
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
A what?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Wait a second. He knows I know.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Speaking of which...
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
You may.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Be careful.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
I'm sure.
Here, use mine.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
I am not.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
That's not mine.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Where did you learn to shoot?
What are you saying, son?
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Dr. Evil?
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I don't want to.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
He's asleep.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Why?
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
... bottle ...
... love ...
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Sir August...?  What now?
As you see.
We have met ...
Rules are made to be broken.
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Ropes?
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
So am I.
Thank you, Steed.
Valentine, listen to me ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
And just what is the game?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
An eccentric recluse?
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Barely.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
You don't trust me?
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
What kept you?
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Still a bit chilly ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Not quite.
I know all this.
Who's now vanished.
So you say ...
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
Ugh ...
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
You're kidding.
When do the girls get to the party?
What is this person's story here?
Oh, come on, just a little.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Mr. Thomerson.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Sure have...
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
But a fabulous cook.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Are you going to have women at your party?
I can't sleep.
Good...
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Great, Mom.
Quiet, Mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
I think I screwed that one once.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
What's going on?
Milt?
That's it.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Ha, ha, ha.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
You can tell a man by his friends.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Olivier's in that, right?
This isn't right.
C'mon. I insist.
So long, Father.
Who?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
We're gonna be okay, man...
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Thanks for the speakers.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Shut up!
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Hi.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Then who --
I don't have a story.
Trychticholorate.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
No it couldn't.
Yeah.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
I was ahead of my time.
Cute.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I'm busy.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
He's got piano lessons.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Okay.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
You like everybody, Ronald.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
No Marty, I don't.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Just catch the son of a bitch.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Me?
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Let me think about it.
Are you sure?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
What case?
You've really got a problem.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
How 'bout...
B-L-A-K it is.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Ho!
Yeah!
Give me some?
Please.
Delacroix.
What's your name?
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
What do I do?
I'm a revolutionary.
Must be the pressure.
Meaning?
And this is Manray.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
Why?
Mantan!!
How you sound?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I'm sorry I'm late.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm wid it.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
It's been a long time.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Your father is proud of you.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
The pleasure is mine.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I don't want to hear it.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He's just playing big brother.
Light?
That's why it will be so much fun.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
What you did is dead wrong.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Not at all?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
You tellin' the truth.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...too late, maybe around...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
How be dat?
Are you trying to rap to me?
My people love me.
Y'know what?
Good morning.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
I never was more in earnest.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
It must have been some other gate.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Agreed.
Then you must get it.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
The Prince left him only that choice.
When is he to go?
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Yes?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Fine.
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
What do you mean, alone?
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Tell me about them.
You wanna bet?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
How do you know that?
Sir, yes, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
I...
We just want to check your pack --
Do I?
You hated West more than any of us.
Look in my pack.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
I didn't kill him --
Because I was standing next to him.
I didn't --
I don't know --
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
The Senator...
You're drunk --
That's preposterous --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You're crazy --
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
You and the Colonel go back.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
I plan to grow on you.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You mean the falsely accused?
Isn't this how your story goes?
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Fifty minutes.
What?
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
No one's ever left.
Fine, I will.
I brought it.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
No.
Was she nekkid?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
No, I understand.
Can I take your picture?
Please?
I never knew.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
I can.
What's your name, Giant?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Really.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
So how does it happen?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Dad?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
It would kill you, huh?
How what happens?
Story of my life.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
They're your favorite flower.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
I need to lie down for a bit.
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm, what?
But it's not true.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes. But that's a different...
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
No I don't.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
What do you mean?
We'll stop then.
What are you doing here?
Ch...
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
No. It is too judgmental.
No. It's not that.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
What's wrong?
You don't understand anything.
I know you just want to punish me --
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Have you got your passport?
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Sometimes.
Sometimes neither.
So now you hate all women?
You didn't mind too much.
You don't understand you either.
Get out.
Well what have you got?
Not really. Maybe a little.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
She's dead.
Laugh it up.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
It's alright.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Tell me about it.
Right.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Just wanted to see.
You hurt it?
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You take her to a doctor?
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
That'd be nice.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Hey.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Sure.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Let go...
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Why you got me chained?
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Itches.
Uh-uh.
I don't fuckin' cook.
I can handle that.
I tried.
Don't think that'd be wise.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
This Rae... you get with her?
Now, hold up.
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
That's right.
What's on your mind?
You feelin' sick?
Holy shit!
Ronnie...
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Maybe we should do something?
Nick, we can't just --
You said that in the last two places.
Cool?
I don't, that's all.
Yeah...
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
No.
Kampai.
I don't know.
We can't lose.
He gets as much as he wants.
Gaiijin?
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
Tell them I'm not.
No one's keeping him here.
Why would you care?
What if I chant?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Yeah.
Look.
You certainly have a nice place here.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Death.
Come here.
Why?
Well, actually
Like what?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
Your customer, eh?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Do you have something against science?
And what in your estimation works?
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Prosit.
No thanks.
I like you too.
I gotta piss.
I'm doing okay.
No rust?
True.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Me too.
Yes?
What night?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
For holes.
Does it eat?
Why should I be?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Can you?  I couldn't.
What do you want me to do?
You did?
Like?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
What's a long time?
What difference will it make?
No.
I don't have one.
We sure did.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Thank-Q!
For how long?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, brother...
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Yes.
Perry?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Doing what?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Sorry.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
A wife?
Why?!
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Two weeks.
Sorry!
I told you I've never driven before!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Sure.
Uh...yeah.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
My mother's like that.
Yes, it is.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Tempus fugit!
Gerade aus dann links!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
No, son. A pitcher.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Yes, father?! Yes?
I promise. Is that all?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Yeah.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
I just don't want to.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
Thirty-five.
Just look!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
How do you do, ma'am.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes, ma'am.
A psychiatrist?!
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
What about relatives?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
What?
Hi.
Coming!
Mutants?!
I thought ten years.
What are you doing here?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
No, not at all.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Then you got undressed.
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.
No, please. I won't.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Yeah, hurry up though.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
Does that scare you?
Sometimes I think I do.
No, it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
What?
Yes.
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah. okay.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Hey Jeff.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Terrible boring.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That's what I thought.
You want to go talk to him?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
Where to?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Okay.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
What?  What, that guy?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Connor, is that you?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
We... met them last night.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Be careful.
Right.
Fuck!
Aye.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
For what?
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
A-fuckin'-men!
And he is one smart man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Rule of thumb?
Uh... two shooters!
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Can she I.D. them?
Of course they were. How many?
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Why was I not informed of this?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
I'll be back at 9:00.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Well, what'ya do?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Yes.
Yeah boss?
The... The funny man.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
He says. This is he.
What do you think the cops have?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
That sets it off.
You think we're going to be chased?
Like he meant it.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I don't want to use it.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Bob?
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Bob?
This was in fourth grade.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
You were asleep.
Can you hand me those french fries.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
How much?
She needed it.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I did.
Did that hurt?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
It's going back down.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I'm not kidding.
How?
Dignan, I --
Dignan, I --
Scale the --
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Yeah.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Yeah. He said that.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Who's got the car keys?
Dies y nueve.
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
That's your friend Anthony?
That never would of --
Yes. I did.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Don't count it.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
There were more than that.
It's registered in my mother's name.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
You don't even know his name.
Bullshit.
I didn't have any choice.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Where's Applejack?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
26 weeks.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
We're just going over a few things.
Yes.
Can't get it. It won't...
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Bourne comes here? Why?
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Don't know.
Thanks.
The sooner the better.
What do you have, Danny?
Jesus...
Lots of people...
I speak English.
What?
Then what?
Sorry. Old habits.
I don't know.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
No. There's nothing new.
I worry when you get like this.
But it ends up the same.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
What?
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Are you disappointed?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
That's where we came out.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Me? Four years.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Are we hacking or asking?
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
I don't want to leave.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
He was a modest man.
He will. I know he will.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I will not.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Thank you for inviting.
You are. And I'll come again.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
And I with you. But you must wake.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
How do you know this?
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Cute, Evan.
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
Weirder than this?
You know my father?
Yes.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
But I... I need those books.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Hi, Lenny.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Go on. Sit down.
He's a fucking maniac!
Yeah?
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Which is?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Deal. Now read me something.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
Come up here a minute.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, sir.
It's not for sale.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Well, so long.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I will.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't think I will, Rick.
You can believe that if you want to.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
And Laszlo?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Everything is quite all right.
Because you're getting on that plane.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
But what about us?
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
I love you very much, my dear.
Go ahead.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
Yes, rather.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Thank you.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Yeah? What's his name?
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
He'll take one.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Excuse me.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
-- Thanks. I will.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
You think of everything, don't you?
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
No.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Uh, my watch stopped.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Take it, damn it.
Survive today, that's the point.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
No.
As much as anybody.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Let's take a look.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
For when I travel?
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I know.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You too.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
What's going on down there?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
It's me.
Time I had lots of.
Forty-three days.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Hallelujah.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
I need to do it.
San Francisco.  And you?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
I'm *not* a doctor!
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
"King Kong". It's really good.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Please don't...
She knows how to take care of herself.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
Yes, I *have*!
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Really! Is it serious?
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Migrants?
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
You do it then.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I'm happy I amuse you.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Why was he missing for twenty days?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
I was doing it for them.
Today? Started off great...
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
We're going to give him the money back?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
I told you, use less powder.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Help me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Then show me how.
Lighten up.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Intuition.
Don't ruin this for me.
WHAT?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
What?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
I'm sorry.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Eee Oott Auught!
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
High five.
I can imagine.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
What are you talking about?
What's the Blue Book price?
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I'm working on that soccer story.
Who was he?
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I don't know.
Fine.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Probably.
Marion, stop this.
Never. Why do you ask?
Leave me alone, Marion.
I want to buy a car.
Found a job?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
In the casino.
That's fine.
I'll watch.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Who's they?
Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Do you?
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
And what do you do, Lucy?
Nice car.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
No thanks.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
They've been tested.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Very impressive.
Fine.
Fine.
What flickering light?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Hello, bomb.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
But how do you know you exist?
That is correct.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Ah, negative drop.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Not now!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Yeah?
What was that, Doolittle?
Doolittle, hello?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Yeah?
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
You mean until you showed up?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I ain't mad at you...
I don't get involved with guns.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Can you help me get her back?
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
But why can't we stay here?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
When?
Lauren's not my wife.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
That would be appropriate, yes.
You did go through my stuff.
How well do you remember the lab?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Open it.
I don't know what to say.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
You don't want to.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Let go of my hand.
You did.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
How's this about me?
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Bastard...
You and me both.
Got a pencil?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I actually know how this works.
Tell everybody hey.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
How'd you get her out of town?
I'll give it my best shot.
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
Gin.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
It's okay.
Yeah?
Right, slow...
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
YO, DOOFUS!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Oh, yeah...?
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Uhh... nothing.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Let's lift up her shirt.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Neither do I!
GOOD MORNING!
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
I didn't say shit.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
I am so sorry.
We went to a hotel.
Hey...
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Why is that?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
And you'd never been there before?
Why?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Infant Memory Generators.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Where is she?
It's safe here.
Why? Is this about the book?
Yeah...
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
I don't own a television.
Yes.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I... I was playing with fire.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
But you were punished.
Why?
God exists because you're horny.
Where are we going?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Congratulations.
You're not a bitch.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
That's enough.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
What else?
Yep.
But now you can't go.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Loretta, never have kids.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
We was robbed.
We all do. Now let's go.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Bitch!
Bye.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
Mm-hm.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Enid ate a whole pan!
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
"My dear"...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
What's the matter with you?
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
Yankee Poodle.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
What do I get?
She did.
You told it to me.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
That's not bad for any day.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
I can't do it...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary?
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You swine!
That's it...
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Two, please.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Well, these things take time.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Shut up!
I intend to.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Right... Right.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I could easily arrange...
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
Yyyess.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Of course! What did you think?
Thank you very much.
That's a canopy, John.
Not at all, John.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Yes.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Fine.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Welcome home, John.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
There IS no one.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
I said welcome.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
It was different...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
I'll bring it back.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
The second note to wake the Gods...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
That I cannot tell you.
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
REALLY?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Yes?
You don't love ME.
What -- rape?
Oh, get it over with.
What?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Well... no...
Find it... AND cross it!
He was lucky...  Sit there.
It saved my father!
No.
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
Don't you FEEL it?
What's it all about?
Sorry!
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
So?
Just say something cheerful.
But...
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
That's it!
Mum! Dad!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
I... I...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
What have you got there?
Can't make enough swords!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Relax!
Help!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
No... he's not... not... there...
I never do...
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Say hi to Naomi.
I told you that later.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
You did? You liked me?
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Hi.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I'm not nuts.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
That's okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Yeah?
You know Wilmont?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Yeah, I guess.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
I want to have a baby.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Is that what you want?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Okay.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Um, no.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I don't know.
Hey, Joel --
Says you were a bully...
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just walked in.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Your dried cum.
Long day thinking.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
It's too late.
That's your look for me.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Well... I did.
You take it. I don't know.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
Go back to sleep.
In a minute.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Very cool. Trippy.
'kay.
It's a good one all right.
Go.
You love him, don't you?
Well, what should we do?
You better go.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Thanks, Stan.
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I have a family, Mary.
It was a mutual decision.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Just wanted to let you know.
This one's history. Moving on...
Patrick, we need to focus.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Save your breath for the climb.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Easy come, easy go.
I'm staying with the Countess.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
About...
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
I have to go, Julian.
I'm the best.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
Coop, where are you...
On my way.
What about the accumulator...?
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I'm telling you, I saw it...
It is not.
Trauma.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
Hear what?
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
What's on your mind?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
What you got, Peters?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Negative.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
What do you want me to say?
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
What makes you think I'll miss?
You know.
What is that?
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Something like that, yeah.
Starck...
Let's go.
Keep your eyes open.
How much oh-two do we have?
Carbon dioxide?
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What's going on in there, Starck?
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Yes.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
Keep him talking.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
It's cold.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
The forward airlock.
I like the sound of that.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Victor must've taken him.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
He's made a few changes.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Got it, teach.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Go back to the drawing board.
What do you mean "complete"?
That's terrible news...
So are you!
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
I can go hotter!
Right, whatever, have fun.
Johnny.
Okay, "mom."
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
And if he's not...?
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
What...?  Oh.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
You were?
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Hilarious.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
I understand the business reasons.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Susan. What are you doing?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Oh, I think you already have.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
You want to work at Carl's?
Don't worry about it.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Totally.
This is how I dress all the time.
Your friends use the pool too.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
I didn't say that.
See you later.
No.
Okay, Dennis.
Yes, sir.
Sure. Come on in.
Well...
Come on...
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
We've got to get an abortion?
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
All right. Pay attention.
Damone. It's Mark.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Okay. See ya.
And they don't call my parents?
I thought he was out of town.
Then don't hassle it.
This ain't no cop.
Just be glad you're all right.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Should we buy a frame for that?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Really?
Believe it.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I think they're both virgins.
No.
What do you want?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
No problem.
The point sounds fine.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
I've heard that, too.
Two more Cokes.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Yes... It makes sense.
Awake? What do you mean?
Not for me.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
A major!
Hell, no!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Jesus! Did I say that?
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
My heart!
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GO?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
How about a check?
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
It's gone too far.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Never missed a plane yet.
I fear nothing.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Spare me.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Nah, I got the gun.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Where's that?
Come on, come on.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
In the corner, behind the curtain.
What?
Who's with me?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Yep.
What?
What's in the back?
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
He shot you the other time.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Huh?
Holds four.
Oh? And what's that?
No bullshit.
You keep that key handy.
If he doesn't shut up...
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
Get something on that.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Nothing, just lookin'.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Not without you!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
That's one piece of four problems.
Stop her!
I'm fine, I really am.
I'll do anything to help.
Deal.
I think --
Um, well...
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Very fine bone structure.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Frances.
An actress.
GET OUT!
Showdown.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
All square, Doc.
I know you believe that.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
He's a socialist, then?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Thank you.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
You can always come see it in London.
No, I don't hate it.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Don't touch me.
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
You think I'd miss it?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Eight stories.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
What'd you do?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
The speech? Real good.
Mama, what's...
Then why did you bring them?
Where are you going?
Sure.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
I have!
But what --
Don't I know you?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Frances, I'm warning you...
What?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You drove him to his torment.
Worse.
Yes. Very close
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
There is something I want.  A friend.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
There, there... shhh...
Aren't you?
Nothing can. Not ever.
The world is a dizzying place.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
So do I.
Why the change? What about your work?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
It wouldn't dare.
As a march hare.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Why?
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Tomorrow is another day.
I was careless.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
You're right. It makes no sense.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Okay.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Wet. I don't know.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I meant everything.
Oh, you...
Somebody'll see.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
A short somewhere.
Get behind him more.
Where's Ned?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
I love you.
Ned!
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
I call it my shower dream.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
One night on the town.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Sure.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
So do I just follow you?
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
He's running the show.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Sorry, I need everybody.
Auto wreck.
Real McCoy.
Yes.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
In the Winnebago.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Sure.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
You believe me don't cha?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
-- This conversation is over.
Sight seein'.
What?
She's in the other room.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
What?
No, I didn't.
I did?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
They broke when you fell.
That's what you look like.
Where are you?
It don't look together.
Okay, I'll have one.
That's what I hear.
Who's "we"?
Don't say my name.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Thank you, sir.
I'm fine, sir.
Didn't take long.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Pardon?
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
No, sir.
Across the board, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
I'm not sure what --
Sir?  What did he say?
Sir...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
What changed?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
No, ma'am.
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Is this my glory, sir?
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
I saw an article...
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
What?
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Thanks, Wick.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
You heard me.  Move on.
"Dad."
I think you're the liar.
Your new roommate.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
O'Neil, Jordan.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Oh yes he will.
You must have quite some harem.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Who is he?
Nick Tatopoulos.
That's the problem. He did.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Have them sealed off.
You're fast.
We know.
You're standing on it.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Thanks.
We've met before.
Are you sure? How do you know?
So you're in?
It's okay. I know her.
It's Raymond.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
You go first! There's no time!
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
I had the shot...
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
All this from watching the.. historical records?
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Yes Commander?
GO Commander.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
Never mind, Fred....
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
It's ... incredible.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
Tell them? About...
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
JASON...
I don't think that's a cloud...
Right.
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Closer?  I can try.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Thanks
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
And determination.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Oh god...
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Get oacK on their tail.
What does she see in them?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
While they're strung out?
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
No.  I guess.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Delighted, sir.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Who's in command out there?
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Lafayette is a child!
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
We're leaving them?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
You know very well who it is that I love.
I'd throw everything away for you.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
That's good... who?
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Farrah. Come here.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
So... how many movies you been in?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
I don't believe this.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Leo, I don't know.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Never heard of him.
Look at me, Ray.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
I'm in the movie business.
Not yet. I just started.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You just did.
The shylock's the good guy.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
But you work for the casino?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
Once.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
He drown?
Let's see how we get along.
You're kidding, right?
Get the fuck outta my chair.
Ask your man here.
Twenty seven hundred.
One of mine?
Compass.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
How'd you know I was here?
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
How much is the wife offered?
"Cotton".
Don't go out of your way.
Not yet.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Don't say a fuckin' word.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
You seem to feel fine about it.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Be quiet and listen.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry -
Hello, Martin.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
What?
Roger?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Or uninvited guests.
What're you crazy?
So we kill him?
A what?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Yeah, yeah.
Smugglers maybe.
Sounds reasonable.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
She take a radio?
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Right.
What is it?
What do you propose?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Sorry.
Too big. More like a freighter.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Probably didn't have time.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
There's somebody else on this boat.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
If it was a ship she hit.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Hey.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
That much I think we've already established.
Just lucky I guess.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
I think I see it pretty well.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Go.
What do you say, Dodge?
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
And look what happened.
Shut up.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Who?
YES.
I guess.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
So what do you think?
Huh?
You can count on me, sir!
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
No.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
Yeah, well... hi...
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Hey Josh.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
We should follow them!
Okay, okay!
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
Oh yeah...
Somewhere downtown.
It's always closed...
It'll only take a second.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
You cunt!
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
...maybe we should be lesbos...
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Yeah, thanks.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
What thing?
I don't believe you.
Nothing.
Great...
I said "great"...
I need to talk to you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Well, we won't keep you.
Seymour does.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Where did you get those pants?
Get a job!
You're late, asshole.
Well why do I care about that?
Indian records?
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Wow!
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Good luck...
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Jesus, Seymour.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Are you okay?
Why?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
How can you be so sure?
So, what happened?
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I had to see you.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
Yeah.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
She's not at home?
That slut!
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Why don't we start with that next week?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
That is correct.  Nothing.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Does he speak English?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
So that's what a lion looks like.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
Has it ever done that before?
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Why?
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
My pleasure.
The Upper West Side.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
-- the sorrow --
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Who are they?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Like what?
Hello, Venkman.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
I hate Jello.
What?  Yeah.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
No?  What do I act like?
Are you all right?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
Goodbye.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Really!  Is it gone?
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Die in what sense?
Are you Peter Venkman?
In a storage facility.
No, you may not.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Why not?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
God, it's ugly!
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What do I say?
To go into business for ourselves.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
It's not good, Pete.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
LATER, MAN!!
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Jerses -- tomorrow...
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
I don't know...
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
You don't know how wrong you are.
Why do you play at being drunk?
Yours will do!
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
What deal?
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
They're studying with Cynics.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Chain him.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Hello.
No.
Yes.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
You sure you really want to?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Because I want to know what's happening.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Here he comes.
What do you think?
You've got to tell me what she said.
Because it isn't true.
Then what?
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Yes.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Yes I am.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Oh -- no sir.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
What?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
No.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Why not?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Well I don't know.
So?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Oh my God.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Thank you.
What?
What?
Either one will be fine.
Who said it was my first time?
If you want.
I walk out.
Thank you.
About five years.
Is it?
No.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Are you shocked?
Not particularly.
How do you think.
Oh my God.
There's nothing to tell.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Let's drop it.
Yes.
You're not.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
You wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Sir?
What else?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
About what?
What about it?
To be what?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Oh no.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
You'll never be young again.
Ben, can I say something to you?
How long have we known each other now?
Thank you.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Mr. Robinson?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Not now.
Yes.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Dictation.  You know...
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Very little.
Will you do me a big favor?
Why do you hide in my room?
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
How tired you are!
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
You are beautiful!
What?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
Oh --
I don't want them now.
I know.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Yes.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
We could come to my room.
No -- not at all.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
I thought she was splendid!
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Good heavens. What for?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No, doctor.
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
No.
Yes -- that --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Yes.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- what -- what --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
No -- only occasional jobs.
You pay me.
Me.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
You think so?
Why not?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All you have to do is phone for it.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
You've decided against the merger?
He likes to play the great man.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Goodnight, Suzette.
Why not?
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I want to keep my teeth.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
What? He's going to be all right!
Why? What's wrong?
Roy Dillon.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
No?
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
They twisted my arm.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
I pay my debts.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
You must have some money.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
Never.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Always, for you, baby.
Taking you for granite?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
Mama!
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
You already went back to work.
I'm a salesman.
I thought these people were broke.
Yeah? How?
Upstate where?
Sure.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Gun?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
The cemetery...
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
You're so predictable.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
I'm okay.
Who?!
Looks great.  It does.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
What?
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Kara, no!
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Oh, shit.
At least!
Tell them yourself!
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
Go home!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
How do you know that?
Really?
Sorry.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
I dunno.
What's this?
The posies are for her?
Our pleasure.
You actually sold insurance!
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
What?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!  Out!
Out!
Hello.
Dr. Woodly.
Where's Mom?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
What's good about that?
"The sting."
"The sting."
Where did you get the poison?
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
The smallest thing I've got.
Make it fast.
Leave a tip.
I'm talking to you gently now.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
Shouldn't you lie down?
Nothing would please me more.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I have a brain.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
What a honeymoon.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
I don't think so.
No you're not!
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
Almost a Christmas scene.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
Blue soup?
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
I plan to live one hundred years!
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
You've killed women?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I've got to run!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I've never heard of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Correct.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Now who's being cruel?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
I've struck my blow.
My violin is avenged!
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
No!
If you want to be found that way.
It's trash now, like mine.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
I heard you were looking for me.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Don't!
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
What a relief!
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Stay home tonight!
I didn't know that.
Who have you been talking to?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Then get him.
Oh?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Keeps fairies away!
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I'm glad.
I know.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
Something happens to my confidence.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
A what?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
What?
That's the XKE.
Why would you do that?
I believe in miracles now.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
He died of a massive rupture.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
But is she, has...
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Okay.
What girls you got here?
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Yeah. How did you know?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
You know her?
Tod might know.
Huh?
Ulcers.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
He deals in pain.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
What makes you so sure?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
But then you'll forget about me.
So then, Mr. Mast...
What are you paying me for?
That's like a stag film.
What do you mean?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
I just heard. Who is he?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Pretty good.
What is going on?
What plan?
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Where does he hang out?
Where!
Rucker.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
What?
They're all about the same. You want something?
That's all right.
In other words, you want to get laid?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
I'm worried about Jake.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Yes, I am.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Hello.
Out!
Possession of a stolen shovel.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Where are the papers?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
It's very interesting.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
No.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
My door is always open.
Eh, fine.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
That's really great.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Look, the ice is melting.
Well, I really don't drink...
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Yes. It's almost there.
It's all right.  It's organic.
With Life.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Yes. They're old friends.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
But why now?
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
I don't care what people say.
What about the draft?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
I go to funerals.
Huh?
Well, maybe one.
No.
No.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
You think so, sir?
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
She took my head.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
I knew you'd come.
It certainly is.
If anyone can help, HE can.
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
You were ALL human!
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
See what??
Is he serious??
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
No. It's not.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Who wards off demons.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
No. Don't --
Oh-n-no -- I --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Alone?
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Cocky.
I know.
What -- ?
What?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
We're leaving.
It'll go in.
Julia's my second wife.
Who are you?
No!
To a man called Frank Cotton?
It's important.
I don't remember.
Oh.  Oh yes.
I don't want to see the dress.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What do you want me to do.
You're hurting.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
You promised me an explanation.
Who did?
So you were cheated.
Yes. They'll never find us.
I don't.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
I saw everything.
We're going to freeze to death.
Ah!
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
So what's the argument?
Just feeling a bit sick.
Please...
I don't know where to begin...
What?
You want something to drink?
That's right.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I prefer the floor.
Maybe I will.
What happened to me?
Wait a moment --
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Try me.
Daddy?
No Dad.
O.K.
Surprise.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I've forgotten.
I love you, honey.
What?
Finished?
I want to see.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
Oh no.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
You're not even coming?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
I have all of the others.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
He's not worth it!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
What do you mean, four more?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
What's his name?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
It's Vince and Justin.
You look upset.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Hi.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
No.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Nothing.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
You're tougher.
Hi.  What are you doing?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
I mean it.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Well she --
Enough of what?
Thank you.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Well we don't.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Sure.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Basil the II.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I've been to Church Hill.
Tradition.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
That bothers you?
You had to do _nothing_!
Not all of them.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
They do it each year.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
Follow me.
Yes.
That would be difficult to explain.
You killed those other two.
Is that a threat?
All of it finished.
The inheritance.
I'm just curious.
What do you want from me?
Four?
What are you getting at, Moran?
You're an asshole, Moran.
It's that important?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Please go to no trouble.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
You are still so very young.
This is madness!
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
I feel hardly nothing.
Of course.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Far away.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
We need more time.
Stay out of it.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
I had no choice.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Where did you learn that?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
How many came?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
You're wrong.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Are you here?
And if I refuse?
Should I care?
Yes.
It doesn't.
That's none of your business.
Your murder weapon?
Do you?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Hello, Bensinger.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hello, Bruce...
Yes!
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
No -- she didn't.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
The money? Why?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Your luck's not with you now!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Listen, Walter --
No!
Get away, Svengali.
Where'd you meet this man?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
No kidding?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
I'd like to think.
I get it!
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Okay, Walter.
Where's Bruce?
What tickets?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Come here. See if we can move it.
Will you come here?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
I'm busy, Duffy.
What?
They can't do that to me!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Three bullets! Any good?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
What?
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
An attempt to ruin us!
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
I never saw him before!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
I'm telling you!
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
What did you do with her?
Phone for you, Hildy.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
I'll go right after it.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
No -- what?
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
That's good.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Ssh!
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Forty dollars.
The what?
You mean here in the city?
No, I don't think so.
Yeah?
You can't bribe me!
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Say, Hildy...
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
No, she didn't.
Looking for shrapnel.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
We thought it was poison.
He's the worst liar.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
They might be.
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Bugger the Buffs.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
You taste it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
No, I won't.
There, there, my baby.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
And now we're glad you did.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I know you mean well.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Really, that's a long time.
Yikes.
Huh... what cone?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Oh yeah, the tree.
A dead one.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Fucking great.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
I don't drive cross country.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Way out here?
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
I'll help ya.
Thanks.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Lock the fucking doors.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
It's a girl.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
What?
What!
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
I gotta open the gate.
What I need are some answers.
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
He should be back in a couple hours.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Grab Mary and come inside.
I don't want to see that.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
When?
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Keys.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
What!
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Where we headed?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I pray to God there is.
Excuse me for a second.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Gabrielle.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oui. Perfect!
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
That would be good.
Yes. Happy happy.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
I don't know. Something's missing.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
One night stand?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Please, honey, let me in.
Where?
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Paper or cloth?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
No biggie.
Yes, and...
I'll be out in a minute.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
That's a great idea.
Fifteen.
He looks perfectly fine.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
You are an animal.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
How come?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Shit.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Yahoo!
Even better.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
No.
Yes?
Yes... Derek.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
It's open...  What'll you have?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
That's right, Miss Packard.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
For whom and for what?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Good, good.
Deal the cards.
It's possible.
Twelve thousand.
Cut.
Yeah? Why?
What is?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
I got drunk.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Thanks for the drink.
Kiss off.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Where do I sign?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
You hustlin' me?
I don't know.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
I'm a businessman, kid.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
I don't want it.
I feel tight -- but good.
Get with what?
Give me a drink, will ya?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Aw, Eddie.
Is that what you think?
Now and then. Why, do you?
Oh no, nothing for me.
Yeah, sure has.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Okay, friend.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Shoot.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Call it.
Since four.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Fair.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
No, not always.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
You told me.
I'm getting treatments right here.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Is that what makes a winner?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Twelve. Cross side.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Thousand dollars a game.
Let's go.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What do you mean?
Who?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Yes.
Do we have to?
That's the Air Force Base.
If we want it, it is.
I'll take you to school.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
About what?
Yes.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
The back door was open.
What?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
I take it you've heard.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
Can't this thing go any faster?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
College nickname.
It's perfect the line is busy?
Oh shit, we're late.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Better than we thought.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Yeah, but what an entrance!
No. Exotic.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
How to kiss ass.
Jimmy, stay with me.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
We should leave too.
Deploy.
Yes.
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Air... water... your "sun."
You are on your own?
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Where?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
What?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Yes?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Find something?
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
What?
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Junior!
I came to get you! What do you think?
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Good point.
Look, can we discuss this later?
My lucky charm.
Try and burn through the ropes.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Head for the fireplace!
...the solution presents itself.
What final challenge?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I was the next man.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
I don't know. We'll find out.
"J".
Ready.
That was seven hundred years ago.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Come on -- come on!
I'll take the camels.
But, Indy --
No.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
My name is Kazim.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Yes, I understand.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
What evil?
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Siam.
Oh yeah?
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
A SNAKE!!
Just one arm!
PET IT??!!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Just try and control yourself.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Don't catch cold.
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Quiet!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
What above the curves?!
Not quite.
Al ???!!!
What's going on?
Don't do that.
What is your name?
I just got here.
Where are we?
What street?
Yeah?
No.
Who am I?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Loading a gun.
Hear voices don't I.
Then I'm crazy.
Yeah.
Oh...Gooood!
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
No. Don't tell the guards.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Go out, take your first left.
With Authority!
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
You'll be me.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
What is it?
Little late for that.
.
To the hotel. To register.
Rene...
Not blue enough.
Why not?!
The beautiful one.
Who, me?
Just hold them close and stay still.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
Not her. You!
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
You found her.
Osaka?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Don't worry!
Too late.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
Come on.
...Shit! It's just money.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
What exactly?
About what?
That's nice.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Don't give her your name.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Let us get to the border!
Rene?
Who's our little man?
Then how did you know?
Surveilliance on them all.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
He's not an ordinary man.
We insist.
I think I've heard of you.
What about it?
Oh.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
I noticed you staring.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
What's what?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
I didn't say anything.
No. No one to speak of.
Me still. They left you alone?
It's not apparent.
You're talking to me.
...Naw. Made that up.
And you, what do you like?
They kidded me a little.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
One chip?
Ryuji and Gruner.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
He plays it all the time.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
You coming along?
Can you?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
They asked about you.
Why?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
It was you.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Why are you on to him?
What about the others.
Thank you.
Yes.
What does he know?
Whoever took it does.
So we better get started.
Okay.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
I heard them.
In the backyard.
How long?
I'll be there.
Okay.
What do you mean, what's it do?
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Maybe later.
Lunch?
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
What caliber is your gun?
Okay.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Soy sauce...
That's my stuff from the office...
No, thank you.
I'm doing an interview.
Where should I wash them?
Jeffrey...
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Hardly new news.
Who are these people?
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Oh, lots.
Everything interests me.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Why am I gonna mention your name?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
They do this with impunity!
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
I'll call them, Lowell.
I don't know what to do.
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Well, what do you really think, though?
Liane has filed for divorce...
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Chapter and verse.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
They hate each other --
Howard!
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who do you want me to kill?
Triple!
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
So, that's good, right?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Why do you think she did it?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
To him? He's a sick freak.
So I hear. Is that all?
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
What is it Miles?
Huh?
Did you just propose to me?
Yes.
Yes. Again.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
I bet.
May I come in?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
What kind of "stuff?"
That's blackmail.
Marylin?
Please! Leave the house.
Murder?
Marylin.
You used his credit card.
Of Massey Myerson?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Rex, please.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Sorry.
No. You're not.
HA!
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Mother?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Muriel Rumsey.
Maybe next time.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Yes, I knowbut
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Why don't you put me in chains?
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I'll get it annulled.
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Stunt?
Nothing.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
On the road.
He's marvelous!
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
No, I'll go through with it.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, please, Dad
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
What do they say?
But the lady says
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Yeah?
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Are you talking to me?
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
You must have me confused with
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
I can't go out like this.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Yeah?
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Next week "East Lynne."
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
You're prejudiced.
What?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I hate the horrid stuff.
Amazing.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Mind your own business.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Come onget in.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Come here, you little fool!
Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
Why, he'll be back.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
What time is it?
Yeah!
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Yeah? Where?
Yeah.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Collect?
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Hey, you!
Thanks.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Orange, New Jersey.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
No, I did not.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
I had the cause of death.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No, you don't!
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
How many shots you say you heard?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Willie O'Keefe?
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
It's going to get worse, honey.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
Take a look across the street.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Between six and seven seconds.
The Warren Commission call him?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
His name?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Never touched me.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
That sounds fun.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Oh, that's not a problem.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
She wants to make a deal.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Arrest me.
That's my diet shit.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Who do you think I am?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
It's kind of a sports bar
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
I am, as a matter of fact.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
How many trips did you make?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
Yeah.
It looks nice.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You're not old. You look great.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
When did you decide?
The day you got me out of jail?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
What if I've figured a way?
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Set him up.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Can I smoke?
You never asked me if I did or not.
No.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
A Broadway shopping bag.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
Great...  ...Wanda!
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Yeah, do you like it?
They told me.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Talk to you tomorrow.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
They already know it's you.
Who?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Where you gonna be during all this?
Susanville.
Uh-huh.
Bank robbery.
It's a diet thing?
No.
Does that bother you?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Which one is for the car?
What do I do?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
The moon -- I dunno
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Not now, pick me up.
I shot her.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
We went to the parking lot.
Maybe the Feds got it.
What?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Haven't a clue.
House.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Was she?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Winston found you.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
That I gotta see.
It's Beaumont.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
He leave town?
Where do you want to go?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
How do you know?
Me, too.
It's short, huh?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Maybe the demons are real.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
It was the window.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
But the paper ...
No. Not really ...
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
Her knee acting up?
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
I don't know what to say.
Hell, you think I am?
I don't want to know.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Your back? Did you fall?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Where is the lamp?
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Gabe.
Where are we?
Show me Della!
It's gone to the top.
The numbers stop at 107.
That's your decision.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Lie down!
Am I home?
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Mid-town mostly.
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down!
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Well that's good to know.
Push 'em back.
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Nope.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's wrong?
You in trouble?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know what to do.
What do you mean?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
How did it happen?
Pour it in.
You got lucky.
Pause play.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
We could convert fission transistors.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
My job.
Not a chance.
You got that right.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Were you close to your father?
And what happend to ...?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I know you.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I get it.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
GO, GO, GO!
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Just get us to the ship!
Small brains make your balls itch?
That ought'a help the situation.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
I'm just saying.
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Are there any other shuttles?
You killed him?
Oh shit! There he is!
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Keep trying!
Then open the doors!
What?!!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
But...I...400 years?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
It's okay.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Here --  Take him home.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
I never hear the whistle.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Can you do that?
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
I didn't agree to that!
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Why?
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Rogue?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
Be careful, for chrissake.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Some friends and me took a house.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Anti-Shark cage.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
I'm okay...
What do you see?
And I'll drink to yours.
I think I can top that, Mister...
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Cool.
I don't know...
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Um, hi?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Huh?
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Okay.
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Excuse me?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Oh, go fly a kite.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
What do you play?
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Why? What the big deal?
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Consider it your musical education.
Come on, I have something for you.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
What are you?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
There are ads? For parents?
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
I'm pregnant.
What?
Right, seriously.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Yeah, downtown.
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
What's Early been in jail for?
Almost.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
What do you need a Bible for?
Yeah.
Nah... how much money have you got?
If you say so.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Not yet.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No.
Siesta.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Umm. Altogether?
Yes!
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
You fucked it?
Did what take?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
What?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Unzip my pack, yo.
Right.
Right.
Yep.
He looks like my uncle.
Who?
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why I give pennies?
So.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Good luck?
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Why not? You stink.
Nothen' B.
Yeah.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Right now?
She won't? Why not?
Yeah. I can understand that.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Yeah?
Yes.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Come on.
Do you care about me?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Do you care about me?
What?
15.
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
No, I didn't bleed.
Mine?
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
It's like...
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
You've heard the stories right?
Oh god. That's horrible.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
It's grandmother style.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
What?
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
What do you want?
I was at the beach.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Run it down.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
What was your relationship with her?
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
Did anyone stand out?
What was suspicious about him?
He was with me?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Did you know her?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You like to brag, don't you?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
The game's over.  You lost.
Very good.  How did you know?
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
He was watching you.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
My cheering section.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Six, eight hours tops.
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Bingo.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That's great.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
We're not sure.
It's important.
But we heard him.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Anything else?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
We're going to work on the message.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Ten days ago.
Through a rental agency.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
I want to be the best I can.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Yes.
It is.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
You sound like my mother.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
You're not?
Because I think he's wrong.
And you?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
What do you want on it?
What's wrong?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
What?
Can I come in?
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I'm sure you are.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
Colwyn.
Colwyn ...
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
I won't leave you here.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
Turold's son was to marry her.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
He has come for Lyssa.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Where the spiral begins.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
You're coming with us.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Saddles.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
What business?
You and I will guard the fire.
How did you know I had sons?
Not sleepy, either?
We must try to get horses.
Yes, my lord.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Would you settle for a boar?
We'll meet you at the inn.
No.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I only want one.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
You had better manners as a pig.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
I knew.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
No.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
No?
...Not at all.
Do you need money?
Huh... 500 meters?
How can you say it?
Perfect.
OK.
No, you can't go out.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
I never rent my gear.
What?
...17.
...Later.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
I love you so much, Leon.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Yes.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Mathilda, listen!
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Thank you.
You need a ride, Preacher?
That's enough.
I'll kill you!
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
You're talking to me?
I've changed my mind.
You've just decided, is that right?
You can change.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
He's plastered.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Go to sleep Ellen.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
This guy's not a murderer.
That's all right isn't it?
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
By car right?
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
What Mr. Parker?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Good morning.
What?  Who are you?
What are my choices?
What do you think I should get?
...Noooo.
No.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
What?
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
When?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Can we just ignore it?
Let's stay for a while.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
Where have you been staying?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
No.
Yuri... are you...
I have a 4.0.
Get up.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I guess.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
Yes, I am.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What?
See?
No.
I'm so happy for you!
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
What?
Yes, you are.
Yes, he is.
You guys are so sweet!
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Not yet.
Neat.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Maybe not to your face...
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Oh, my God!!
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
That's why I think it's time for us to --
No.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Harvard. Law school.
Thank you. Having fun?
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Thank you.
Chuck.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Yeah, luckily.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
What do you want with me?
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I am afraid of nothing.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Oh, yes...
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
What does she want from me?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
There must be an answer somewhere.
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Something's coming.
Careful, lad.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Jack, don't!
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Fire away!
It's what we'll find there worries me.
The wound is mortal.
I don't... understand.
What weapon?
Patience, lad.
Don't get too far!
Never show mercy!
Where?
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Never.
I may have said perhaps...
Are you honest?
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Sorry.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Heading north still?
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Up ahead!
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
It's done... we'll never catch him.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Oh, but I have.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
You follow.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
We can work.
Since seventh grade.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Who are you?
What's wrong?
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Monday.
What did you think it would be?
What are you doing here?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
You look better without make-up.
Yeah.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Does everything have to have a point?
I'm not gay.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
What?
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
It could have been a squirt gun.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
And if I enclosed it?
I flushed it down the toilet.
If that's what it takes.
That's too long.
She didn't really say.
Uh huh.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
No I'm not!
Goodnight.
Why?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
You'll have money when you work for it.
I don't know.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
Sit down for a second.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
How do you become something you're not?
Nothing.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Yes.
I'd build a house.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
But you can't call me while you think?
Money?
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
You bit my finger.
What?
So could I.
Should I?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Hey.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
Why?
What did you say?
Someone stop her!
Yes, it is.
Nagger?
Better make it a week.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
You went to Monroe?
Good old Monroe.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Nothing.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
So you made a generous contribution.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
He does it all by himself.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
What do you want, Claude?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Him?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
That was five years ago.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
I'm all right.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Hey, Ray...
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Rayford!
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Absolutely not.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
So excited.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
She's so nice.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
It would be so okay.
You're already there...
No.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not me, moron.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
What can I do about it?
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Definitely.
How bad?
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Beast.
I know, your wickedness.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Yes, great movie...
I'll just go to Heaven.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Really?
Why are you laughing?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
What are you doing?
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
East Rutherford.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
I have to, Valerie.
From my dad's side of the family.
I love you.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
See something you like, my man?
I don't know?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Up there.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Well... you can't have them all.
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Did you?
Anybody we know?
It has nothing to do with you.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Jessica.
No.
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You know.
That's nice.
I have.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
They won't listen.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
We'll be all right...  We will...
To what?
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Beloved wife...
For as long as I can remember.
Gracious... no.
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Okay.
This is our bedroom.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
Right... This just glided along.
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Me, too.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Andy?
Okay...
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice, I...
Alice?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
Sure.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
No.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Out in back.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
What's the word on the street?
I don't know yet.
Not even close.
A headache?
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
The first night... Not the last two.
My... My head.
What are you going to do?
A videotape.
What night?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Two detectives are coming out.
Thanks, guys.
What?
Was there?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
All right!
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Yeah?...
I don't know.
It was weird...
I don't want to talk about it...
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Come on... get in.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Come on.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Why, of course. Yes.
It certainly is.
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
I'm thinking.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Just call me Barney.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
No.
Nothing. Why?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Well - I'm
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
That's intelligent.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You're startled?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
The only one.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Splendid!
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Yes.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Let me go, Bob!
Why - I'm sorry - but I
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What was that?
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What if he refuses?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
I wonder.
Bump?
You see, it's not a dream.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I'd love it!
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Hesitated, sir.
Cowan--
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
It's not even a fucking door.
We're the government, Cowan.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
All the time, sir.
What?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I taught kindergarten.
Why?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
And what's this ... ?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
The Pentagon.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
All of it?
Do have any idea what I just said?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
They respond to fear, right?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
How could it not?
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Nothing.
Come again?
Wait-- listen--
Where's he making his big speech?
Did it leave?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Can you see?
Is it now?
Anderton, leave.
Please --
What is it?
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
She died?
Oh, Jesus...
Yeah --
We know each other?
Yes, you did.
They were performance pieces.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
How do I find the --
-- go blind.  I know.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Hang on, Lamar --
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Yes, sir.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
I'm not getting halo'd.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
No maglev system.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Yes, it is.
You gonna tell on me?
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
I need your help.
I need help with her.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
So?
They don't belong to anybody.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Wanna hear something funny?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
The precogs were wrong.
The what?
I'm... not... a... killer.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
So you won't help me?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
You look great.
Lamar --
Tell him not now.
My God...
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
None of your damn business.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
There's thousands of units like this one.
We can stop him.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Sure.  Raincheck.
Yes.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
What does he want with a precog?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
What's 'incidentals?'
So?
Is it the good room?
See you later.
We're in Fashion.
Holy shit.
He's alright.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
We used to take baths together.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
He's not doing it.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I'm ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Yeah? You sure?
Ho's a good guy --
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
There's no touching.
I don't get it.
You driving her?
Yeah. Where is he?
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Sure. Yeah.
Me? No. Not really.
Why?
That's why they call it the smart money.
I'll work it off.
No.
Ruiz knows about this?
You told him you liked him.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Yeah.
Nah, man...
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ricky's taken care of.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Don't be shitty.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you.
I thought you hate that club.
Sorry coach.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
What are we delivering?
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Yeah, I guess.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Fuck...
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
I told you what they said.
What the fuck do you...
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Like I said, I don't know.
You would think.
So we're working?
About what?
You got that right.
She was jonesing for me.
We're getting whacked.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You're out of money?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Let's just go now and wait.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Bobby and Ricky.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
You want your surprise?
S'up.
The videos.
Yes.
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Word.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
What?
Yes, sir.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
A rose by any other name would --
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
He had it coming.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
I'm working on it.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
I sure met some.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
No, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
What?
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
You have enough worries of your own.
Hush your mouth.
What do you want me to do?
Shhh!
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Let's get out of this cold.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
That's right.
Please, go ahead.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
The sentences to run concurrently.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Please make way, please --
You better believe it.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Fine as May wine.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
You the man!
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
What can you do?
So what about him?
That's right.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[South America.]
[I have a friend there.]
It's a little late.
I have connections.
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[I want you.]
[Lucky how?]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Yes.
I drink.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I said the plan was right here.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
That's right.
I'm not crying.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
How do you think he got out?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
You need to practice.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
No, that was in Columbia.
I'm sorry.
I know you're not.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Planned what?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
For a year?
She understands men.
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
When?
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
You do?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
I think it's fantastic.
[Is that good or bad?]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
That's what friends do.
What?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
It must be one o'clock.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
You told me.
What happen?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Your son Marty?
Were the lights on?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
Yes, I know.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Okay.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Put on your blue suit...
Marty...
I heard you, Ma.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Hospital.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Sixteen times.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
We're a good team.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
I can't... couldn't.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Radar!
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Not necessarily.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Same here.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
Yeah!
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
There's only one worth noticing.
Just in dreams?
You guys got any black capsules?
You can cut the bow.
That. It's out of the act.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
They can't do that to me!
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Nice.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Are you all right?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Um-hum.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
A hundred dollars!
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
In what man!
A deal?
So?
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh!
Yeah, a little.
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Shut up!
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
The heelots!
Sure. Mostly often.
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
A gag. A gag!
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeah. It certainly is.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Well?
How?
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
No, I didn't.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Did you want to see her about something important?
Uh-huh.
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
No, sir.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Good. I don't want to be late.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
You can't help me, man.
Huh?
I need to get something straight first.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...a car.
Roper...
Roper, we're into it...
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
I'll give you something.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Sorry... Habit.
If you say so.
Like it had to be done.
National Marksman Competition.
It was okay.
Not the ones I'm at.
I think I can handle that one.
Yes.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Yeah, first and second.
We lost.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
She's the one to blame. Not me.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
You worship yourself.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
You heard.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Yeah that's it.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
And you think he'll...
Use your imagination.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
What?
You let us worry about that.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Who's running it!
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
Yes.
True.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Not my problem.
It's his nature.
Who?
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Then where is she?
If she's alive, you get it back.
Cleaning up a mess.
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Realize?
I know.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Resurrection.
Access established.
Speed?
How can we reach Phaedos?
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
What does that mean?!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
What's a Triac?
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
Look closer.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Wait for me!
GO IVAN!!
So they've been destroyed?
GO POWER RANGERS!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
Strength in numbers!!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
And I ain't no nigger either!
You've got the public upset, Al.
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Whatever you say, Boss.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
No. Not everything.
Scared.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
You got men on Profaci's place?
How's Bugsy doin'?
That ain't what your mama said.
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
I can just imagine.
I must be going.
I'm already late.
I needed to see you again.
It's too late.
Why? You're the innocent one.
London?
It always is.
I'm doin' business here!
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
Come off it, Bugs.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Didn't know you felt that way.
They're friends of our enemy.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
The name's Charlie.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
I don't fuck my partners.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Masseria's been after me too.
Fuck 'em.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Just wanted ta say hello.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Bend over?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Thank me next time you see me.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Why?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Maybe you could talk to Death!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
He called me "Doc."
Who?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I'd better go report this...
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
<u>What</u> union?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
All right. You can come.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
What?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Uh-huh?
What pictures?
Behind the books.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Mm hmm.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
And where is she?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Where's the Majority Leader?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Would you settle for a husband?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Who?
Yeah. What about the second act?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Yeah. Funny--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Do we *have* to?
What?
Huh?
He's a house-afire!
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
What is it?
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Ma! Hold him!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Emma!
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
I beg your pardon?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
The porter's got them. They're coming.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
No.
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Will he *yield*?
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
The man downstairs said number--
Convene?
No. What had you better--?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Right.
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Tonight.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Yes, I see that.
We're over in the House.
Try sitting down.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Why?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
No!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
In Terry Canyon?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Great.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Not another bill?
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
But--I've done everything I--
Hurray!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Wonderful!
And how's your bill, Senator?
Well--I--
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"So help me God."
Ring the call to quorum.
How's that, buddy?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
No?
Oh, now--that won't do--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
Yes--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Just a minute, Joe!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Page boys!
Some people like it.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Sometimes twice.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
No.
Would you like to go for a walk?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Yes, but I
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Really?
Oh, I don't mind.
What are they going to do?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
What did he play?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
I'll get my hat.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
I don't blame you.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Yeah, then what?
With pay!
Uh-huh.
Have lunch.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Shhh!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Oh, yes sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Better wire him right away, John.
Mr. Cedar!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
Okay.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
When?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Only common sense.
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
Take the stand!
Not at all.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Don't pay any attention to her.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
South Dakota - but on the top.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Every man to his taste, sir.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
I did what!
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
Looking for?
What, sir?
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
One hundred books?
You must have been concerned.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Why's that?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Ernest, what do you think?
...And I from Phyllis.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Are we?
How do you mean?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
You've done well.
A little.
Tastes good.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
I'd better get in there.
Yeah.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Don't need it.
That would explain it.
I'm trying.
Martin.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Mumford... like the town?
No, I really don't.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
What?
Uh-huh.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
Either one.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Of course.
You're upset.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
What?
Will you be here?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
What happened today?
True. Should we stop them?
What'd he say?
Really?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Is that the question?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Yep.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Just you.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Really?
Yep.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
I've had worse.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Intestines.
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You will not believe it.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
Proceed!
I would never!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
I just decked your brother
Really want to know?
We're about to be shown the way.
Who was talking about what?
You dream about dead guys?
That bad huh?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
What?
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
I'm his daughter.
And some sandwiches --
Atta, boy!
Me, too.
What did he mean?
Hello?
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
He's dead.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
I got it.
Should I kill them?
Frankenstein!
Sure -- I guess.
Why not?
Me.
You're a spy.
Why?
Roy.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos!
We had an off night, that's all.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
How could I see him if he's invisible?
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
But there's still only six of us.
Because that's what it is.
But I just don't feel it.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
No.
Hey... he's gone.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Oh hi, Mom.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Who are they?
Or both.
Sorry.
The who?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
I think it's absolutely charming.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
No, thank you.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
And where is Joseph?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
That is incredible.
No, sir, none at all.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Would you like some brandy?
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
And you, Junot?
Are you trying to insult me?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Yes.
No.
I cannot promise you that.
Promises mean nothing.
Five minutes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
There's probably some explanation.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
I wrote it.
Yes, I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
My God, what do you think?
I know.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Yes, sir.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
That's it?
Thanks, Unc.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Why you say that?
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
I'm his cousin.
Yes you did.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
I know, be still.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
That's the sister.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
You already in.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
I don't.
I didn't see nothing.
Me too.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
It's locked.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
I'll remember.
Have you seen Day-Day?
I saw it.
Come on.
Nice to meet you?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Let it go!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Yeah.
What urgent message?
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
I'll take you later.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
What's the matter?
What's he doing here?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
I...
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
No.
I would also like to apologize.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Then I have time for a drink.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
You fucked up.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
Let me talk to her again.
No, that's,..that's fine
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
No way.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Keep it.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Thank you.
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
What?
Laughs.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
You're a big girl, huh?
Help me get her off the rug.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Come with me, honey.
Only you.
Do it!
You, Preacher?
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Not even her?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
No.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Don't!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Tricked us!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
How?
What!
There! What's so hard about that!
You better not sing that song.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sshhh...
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John, where are we g --
She talks to herself.
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Yes. Yes.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
Under the stone in the floor.
Come to me, boy!
What secret shall I tell?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
All right.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
She turned me out of the bed.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
Harry, what --
Yes.
She took them kids with her?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
When did I ever?
No, nothing.
I sure as hell hope so.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Okay, okay.  I think.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Just want to talk to him a second.
Sure, but...
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
I will.
Great
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Just sleep now, Mom.
No.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Jungle man fix Jane.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
I see.
Evening gown?
Possibly.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
No, no.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
I think I need my glasses.
We have opened a restaurant...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Go to bed.
Eight forty-two, sir.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
It is Thursday!
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
No, no.
A day.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
You mean you are deserting Russia?
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
No, thank you.
We did our best, Comrade.
We did it with the best intentions...
Well, we're back home.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
But you had!
No visa.
You're going to force us... huh?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You might hold this for me.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
How long does it take a man to land?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Go ahead.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
I will do my best.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Ni-notchka.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
Wounded? How?
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
I don't like your following me.
Why?
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
My darling.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Darling, darling... please!
No speech?
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
No, no music.
...but big.
Who cried that one?
Please.
Good morning, Swana.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
What is this, Swana?
Do you expect me to believe that?
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
I must ask you to leave.
I must insist that you leave.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes, it does.
Yes.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where do you eat?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
So ... let's go ...
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
I'll bet he would.
I figured that out.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
No, sir.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
And if I stay?
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
What do you mean, sir?
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
No ...
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
My friends call me "Mister President."
What?
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
The White House.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Why?
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
Looks can be deceiving ...
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
You're shittin' me.
Hello ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Elvis I like, too.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Well, we could delete it.
I know ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
You're drunk!
Who else'd be in your truck.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
Would you tell me if you had?
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
No.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
You figure him for a dope runner?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
Mm.
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
So when was he here?
I'm ahead of you there.
I don't know. He ought to...
No sir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Okay.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
I always am.
I never do.
Okay.
I can't plan your day.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I don't know. Had dreams.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
No. I found it.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well -- how come?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes I do.
Yes ma'am?
Hey.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Is Llewelyn there?
You expect him?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
So what're you goin' up there for.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
With what?
See about closing.
Sir?
I could come back then.
You've lived here all your life?
Call it?
For what?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
...Where you want me to put it?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Uh-huh.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
That's twenty-six dollars.
No sir, it's unusual.
Yessir. I understand that.
The what?
You want to change rooms?
Another additional.
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
I'm a welder.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
I didn't say braze.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
I don't know.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
No, Elden, I need to...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Anyway, so what?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
...to see you.
I am?
Umm, I don't think that...
This is really awkward...
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Yes, ma'am.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Oh, Betty --
All the time...
You're late, Eric.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
David, please --
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
It's not really a good time, guys...
I'd slap his face.
Los Angeles, California.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Really?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
The one you were telling me about?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
You never know who you'll see.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Where are you going?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
If we're for real?
I don't follow...
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Hell of a way to die.
I wanted to make a statement.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I know that.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
What do you mean?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
He's waiting...
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
What the hell's going on?
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Sure.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Do not seek the treasure!
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Gopher, Everett?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Not that I'm aware.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Not out the other side his face, though.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, we need that ring.
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
He ain't our daddy!
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Thank you, sir!
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
I wrote. Not every week...
Naw. That's over with.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
A long time ago.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Yes, sir!
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
No.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
I said, come here!
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
I'm a little late, that's all.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
I got my foot on the floor.
Yeah... Mmmm...
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
My kinda group!
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
It sure was.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
What would you do differently?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Your real father?
I know that.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
I can't risk it.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Naw.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
She didn't.
That's right.
I can't just...
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
You know how this gotta end.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
Different tables.
I did.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Yeah, whatever.
We'd like to come in.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Not at all.
Don't!
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
It doesn't work?!
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
"Titanic."
Uh uh.
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
You know it brother.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah, it's me.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Man, fuck you!!!
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Cy... I ain't even sure.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Can you make a deal with them?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
You mean...
We need money first...
Yeah.
No man. Gonna walk.
Brimmer.
And who is we?
Maybe...
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
I said, I'm not my sister.
Goodbye.
With a lace table cloth?
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
That one is a bit more difficult.
I consider them linked.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Perhaps.
I understand, sir.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
You're in no condition to ride.
It's already over.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Is that so?
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes, sir.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Father?
She got me at a more impressionable age.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
That's right.
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
I don't care.  I hate him.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Balderdash!
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
Thank you.
For what?
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Worse.
When?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Bite?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Yayyy!
To remember.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
I swear.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
I guess so...but...
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Yes.
What?
It's Ellie's cat.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Jesus, the road!
Did you see his shirt?
I just said--
And Church will be fine.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
She.  Goes.  Free.
You can't.  I can.
Elizabeth goes free!
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
I'll torture it out of you.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
All right then.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Aye, for us there is.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Or you could surrender.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Very well.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household.
Then why aren't you eating?
I can't breathe.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
The trees are taller.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
We're not going to just surrender!
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Agreed!
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Depends.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Yes.
He's not telling the truth.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
My apologies, Governor.
Until he's done.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
The nanobot is gone.
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
A man?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
So, I guess it worked.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
I guess I should be flattered.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
What happened to it?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
That was 'simple'?
That's right.
No, why?
No, no, I just feel wired!
No problem.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
Like a glove.
The head shrinker at the prison.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
I remember I was trying to help...
That's right.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
How-di-do.
Of course I am Stewart.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Gallagher!
Gallagher?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What are you talking about?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I see.
That's ridiculous.
Why
You're the Tribune man?
Oh, man!
Well, I should say!
Huh?
Is that so?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
No!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
It's the smoke.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Right!
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Right.
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
She did?
And now for that twentieth crack
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
All right, Grandma
Have you seen this?
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
I understand, sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Sure.
What?
It can't be possible.
In my handbag.
... It's a pretty short trip.
No ...
Oh, George ...
I was in a bowling-alley.
I don't want it to go away.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
What are you doing?
What?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
Okay, that's IT!!!
That's not going to happen!
Oh, no thanks ...
"Changes."
One of those ... big beds?
No. Of course not.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Rain.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Yes I did.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Okay--that's enough!
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Owns the hardware store.
I don't think so.
It's in your closet.
Jen please ...
Nothing.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Right here.
Oh ... Hi.
What?
It was a prop for the school play ...
No I won't. I swear.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
My name's David.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
I didn't do anything wrong.
... Yeah.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
Just a little--You know.
TV repair?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Yeah but what are you doing?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
D&D Mattress Man.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I have work, I can't leave.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
I have no idea.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
No.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
I don't know.
Not very well.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Ok.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
It's terrible, no.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
...I don't know what you mean....
Lena?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Just have you for one second, please.
How?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why? ...what?
I know.
Can I ask how much is this?
......and this is confidential?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
What?
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
That's that.
I think you have a call?
....I have seven.
Fine, thank you.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I'm sorry.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
You should go on a trip.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
You have another house somewhere or something?
What is this, man?
Are you going to the party tonight?
I'm serious.
You can't be late though.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I'll see you there.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
At your service, Count.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
You always do.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
Shut down?
And place my reputation at stake?
No. It most certainly was not.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
I am not a wealthy woman.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
I'd rather read, thank-you.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Sure
Randolph!
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
How much?
There's nothing to explain
You needn't use that language with me
I wanted it
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Yes?
Sir?
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Forget it-
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Right-
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
Who the hell's Manolete?
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Please don't say this.
Don't do this
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
This ain't George's doing--!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Yes.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
That's for me to decide.
Yes
Again
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Then find another theater
It's just that my movie is so-
I really think you're
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Where's your wife, Jake?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Whadda you care?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
You want the title shot?
You want the title shot or not?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Where you been?
Well, that's what I mean.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Whatsa matter with you?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
I just wanted to say hello.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Should I hit it?
Come over here.
Oh, Jake.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
No, I'm not.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
All I did...
You're hurting my arm.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What?
OK. Talk.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Don't make no difference no more.
What friends?
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Jefferies?
But his leg!
Namely?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
I think they missed their chance with her.
What time?
Not yet.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Give him evidence.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
You figured that out, huh?
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
I told you that --
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
You did.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Gunnison?
It's me.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Did you get my note?
I don't know what you mean.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
Lisa Fremont.
She pay you much?
How did you know!
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Police?
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
You can tell that from here?
There's probably one in the basement.
Smart girl.
Mrs. Doyle?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
You mean "goodnight."
Without any future?
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
Homework. It's more interesting.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Now, Lisa --
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Still -- those witnesses.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Good luck, Buzz.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
No--
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Yeah!
Yes.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
I was in it.
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
I don't want to learn that!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sorry.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
That's right!
He's home.  I heard the car.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
No.  I don't think so--
What?
I just don't want trouble.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
They're still there!
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Not lately.
When was that?
Get away from me!
No.  At dawn.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
What do you think?
My gun?
They like you.  Okay?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Mom--I'm not--
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
And your folks didn't understand?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Chicken?
Bully for you.
Now that's true!
You going there?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
I felt like it.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Hi.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
It is for me too.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
He hates me.
My mother?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
We were romantic then too--
No.  Why?
Hi.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Gabriel, let him go --
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
...whoever she is.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
He'll be dead when he does.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
One more. Smile. One more.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Tell me again.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
We could live it up and --
I'll see what I can do.
Your brother...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
What the fuck is going on.
Nick, no --
Nick, I love you --
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
They're truck drivers.
You saved me.
I don't know...
Nick, what are you talking about?
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
You shouldn't have.
You said it a million times!
I shared his cell!
What?
What college.
Christmas... Eve...
I said, who the hell made the map?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
Why not.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
What... Powwow...
I don't steal any --
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
Five years. Since it opened.
My what?!
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Ain't there yet.
What?
Yeah.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
GUARD!!!
No, man! No, no, no!
...for Christmas...
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Well...sorry...
What? No...
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
What? Snap out of it!
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What do you care?
No, they're not.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
He don't tip.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Nice Guy Eddie.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
A few cops.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
How can you be so sure?
For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
He ain't dead.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
He asked.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
That fuckin did it!
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
You takin' his side?
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Yeah.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
Hold on.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
I suppose it is.
Maybe it's better that way.
All right -- it's said!
Maybe they will.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Hello, Miss Wells.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
How'd you happen to miss?
I won't again.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
You want to split up? --
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Nobody asked you to.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Yeah, we sure have.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Good night, Steve.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Would they be good to eat?
And you've got me all figured out?
You were supposed to be reading words.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Thanks, Steve.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Hey, I have an idea...
Okay.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Hello Ray.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Open chest!!!
Sure. We can practice talking.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
It looks like the furnace.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
I think so.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Are these all the subjects?
What's this?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
Thanks, handyman.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Because she will lie?
What?
My holy water.
No, I'm fine.
"Fucked me."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??...
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
Always the dentist.
Is there a killer loose?
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Looks good, Mom!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
We can be real quiet...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast.
Oh, honey!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Yes, I did.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Marvin A. Pickles.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Right here!
Bon Appetit!
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
What's he know?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Yes.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
She could use a hundred dollars.
How much have you got?
Hello, Frances.
I can't understand it at all.
I'll try there.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But you do believe me?
A job?
Yes.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I have something even better.
I don't know.
I'm at sea, Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
But why come to me?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
I should like people to read what I've written.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
A gay lot - Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Unless what?
No. She's no longer under my care.
Thank you, my dear.
That's too bad.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
What did he say?
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
We haven't even begun tea yet.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
No.
I feel like they do.
Agreed.
Impotent.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Videotapes.
Who's Donna?
All of these are interviews?
Why not?
Maybe you want to go.
Yes.
Why not?
Don't you want to make one?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Yes.
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
So you lied to her?
And now you can?
Don't you get lonely?
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
That's very flattering.
Why not?
I don't know.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
You did that?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
He does.
Not very often.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Yeah, so?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Why?
He doesn't have a phone.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Cynthia!
I don't want to discuss it.
Well. I can't stay.
No.
Did you take your clothes off?
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
She still is.
Nope.
Nope.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Yes.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Different.
Okay.
So make an exception.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
In here!!
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Right.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
No.  You said three-fifty?
What do you mean?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
He'll be really mad.
Was he nice to you?
Sure.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Uh, OK. Sure.
No. I don't think so.
Down to the incinerator.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
BREAKING OUT
He needs help.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
He was adopted you know.
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Sure thing.
Absolutely correct.
Why?
You're practically naked!
YOUNG BLOOD
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
What does he know about it?
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Gary.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What are you pouring tonight?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Highliner.
Say, is Maya working?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Oh yeah.
Good. How're you?
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Maybe. Recognize this?
No, we're paying for the wine.
I can't help the traffic.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
You said you had it all lined up.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
I'd rather have a knife.
I'm working on it.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Now we're talking.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Want some?
Just a minute!
Uh-huh.
And she likes Pinot.
How do you know?
Miles.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
What?
Nah. I want to watch this.
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
We were supposed to play golf.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Okay! Jesus!
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Deep.
Understanding of what?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
You're an asshole.
Obsessively.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
What's happening?
What exactly are we going to do?
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
I don't have to.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Uh-huh.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Back at you.
See you.
I know. I love that.
Yeah, I know.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Yeah. Thanks.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Good. So did I.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
You golf?
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
She doesn't answer me either.
No dad!
Don't touch him.
You love walks.
...I will.
...I will.
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What time is it?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
What are you doing?
That means they're unemployed.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
You're scaring your sister.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
What do you mean, the horses?
That's why they got you in jail?
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
Sounds good.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Where's Jake?
I just came out to say goodbye.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Not for five years.
You haven't got any money.
Anybody got any ideas?
I'll be around.
Yeah?
I've got a job.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
Believe it.
Why?
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
He'll be here.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Howdy.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Really?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
I don't have any family any more.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
This is a lot of money.
It is that.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I run the place. What can I get you?
You like a good saloon?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Give me some of the good stuff.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
That was my plan.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
Of course.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
I'm glad we talked.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
"Forever".
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
No... it's life.
So you did meet her?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
... so much like her?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Why not?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I was misquoted.
I need flesh and --
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
You saw that?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Hello, Lainey.
I know plenty of boys.
I do.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
I do okay.  How about you?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
She did... didn't she?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
I could get the death penalty.
What?!
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
She looks a lot like you.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Long live the First Amendment.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Yes.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
... digitized.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Tell me.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Who me?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
I don't know.
When?
Don't fail me.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
No.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
They did?
Got it.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Stop looking at me.
Meaning?
Chicken blood on the crops.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
The band.
No shit.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I thought you said two hundred.
"And a slash-slash there --"
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
This is his room... isn't it?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Who? Us?!
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Nothing to tell.
Nah. Just you.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Let it go.
Look. You want to talk about this?
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
What'll we do?
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Whatcha' doin'?
Hey, Grant.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Starla, it ain't --
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Yeah. Good.
Okay.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
All the rib eyes?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
That's disrespectful.
Out.
You're pretty.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
If...?
You know how rumors start.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Eleven.
He's after us again!
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
That man is your father?!?
Absolutely.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
They're jammed!
I ran into complications.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Now what?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
I'm here.
What's that, pardner?
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Pick it up, Breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Who's Fred?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Now, you just find him, son.
Chickenshit money.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
That's correct.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And threw us into the lake.
That's not possible. I told you.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
Okay.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
-- You can and you will.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...He does now...
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Got hit twice.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Leave the light off.
Can it work?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Yes.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Where's Sartorius?
Oh, that's a relief.
How much sleep?
I wish you'd told me.
To who?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Not necessarily.
No.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Get out --
Her oxygen would have run out.
I love her.
I won't be making the trip.
I'll go with you.
Why?
Yes.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Stop it.
Rheya.  Not here.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
You don't love me.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
No.  I love you.
Gibarian.  He was here.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Then you won't make it.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
When?
We want to talk freely.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Hard to find doors in this place.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Can we go then?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
No, Ma'am.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I'll come with you.
I came on at 8:00.
Yeah.
Listen, that was my fault.
Hmm...
So it was "love".
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
What do you want?
They called here after you left...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Oh that thing in Queens.
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Do you dance?
"To"... Forget about you.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Mike...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You take care.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I had to follow her to a store.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
What's the difference?
No.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
I heard.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Call a cruiser!
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Lay back, Mack.
Yeah, I think so.
Mom and I got plans.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Remember Little League?
No, no.
See?
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Lemme down, bugface!
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Mr. Jameson--
How about tomorrow?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
I-- uh--
Thank God.
I've gotta study.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Oh, Peter. A zit.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Actually, I got this spider bite
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Just drop me off here.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
Plenty.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Roger.
In this barracks?
So long, Sefton.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Take it.
Thanks.
Which one of you is what?
Twenty-five.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Say, Schulz --
Then droppen Sie dead!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
They'll shoot you, Animal!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You're teasing me again!
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
He's the grrrrreatest!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
She'll never forgive me!
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Do Jimmy Durante!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
I called it the last time, didn't I?
You told them, Hoffy.
You did!
Shoot!
You can tell Father Murray to --
Just what makes you so popular?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
What did you say?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
Twelve years, sir.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I hope so, sir.
On screen.
You're in the Nexus.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
All of us.
Wherever he wanted to be.
It's our pleasure.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Where are the deflector relays?
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
The thought had crossed my mind.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Aye, sir.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
What is it?
Underground deposit?
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
That may be difficult...
I have already made one transmission too many...
Not exactly.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Goodbye, David.
She's to be decommissioned.
I'll need it, Sulu.
About a dozen officers and men.
What about surface life signs...?
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Indisposed, sir.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
But, why?
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
Thank you.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
I have my orders.
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
The Admiral's son.
I don't know.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Spock?
Sensors, Captain?
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Give the word, Admiral.
He'll die -- !
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
How far?
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
It would explain a great many things --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Be careful, Jim...
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Steady as you go...
The ship -- out of danger?
Or the one.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
At what.
Aye, sir.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Stop engines.
Engage warp engines --
Visual.
Battle stations.
Course heading, Captain?
Aye, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
I exaggerated.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Yeah.
Please...
What do you mean?
Would you prefer to do nothing?
-- That's the general idea.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Name?
You play games with me and you're through
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
I was not.
Go ahead.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
A spaceship with a missing man.
... You have a point...
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
In progress, Admiral.
Explain.
How do you know this...?
Yes?
I cannot tell a lie.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
The tank will be finished by morning...
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
I will, Admiral.
Steady as she goes...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
You will be in good hands here.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
... an offlander?
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
This way!
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I understand.
Perhaps, that is true.
No one's ever asked me that before.
No.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Captain, Geordi...?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I don't know.
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
Recommendations?
Do you have everything you need from command?
Do you know how they were damaged?
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Deck ten.
Commander Riker...
Aye, sir.
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Sir?
Make it so.
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
I'm not letting go of him.
Picard to Crusher...
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Was I doing something to your neck?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
But it's comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
... I believe you...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
I look forward to reading your report.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
No... no, please... you cannot...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Vulcan?
Where's the Sphere?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Always am.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
There's a few of us left.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I can try.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
I have to...
That's impossible.
On screen.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Where the hell are they going?
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
What kind of message?
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
We've been set up all along.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Don't remind me.
No way.  You see this?
Come on...
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Stand...?
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
How can I trust --
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Well, I -
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
Your honors, the State rests.
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
But if she's cloaked...
Now we go to Starfleet?
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
Onscreen.
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Where do we come in?
Candidate for what?
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Uhura, signal our surrender.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
So, that's it..
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Spock, you want to know something?
... is to trust him.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Faith...?
Not as yet, sir.
An error.
You can't prove any of this...
We've been ordered to -
You having hearing problems, mister?
Visual!
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
I know precisely where he'll be.
What exactly does that mean?
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
No. Can I move now?
How long is that?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
That was another time.
To happy endings.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
It would appear so.
Fire!
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
Of you?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.

I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
You sick bastard!
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Understood.
What do we know about the planet?
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?

There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Understood.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Aye, sir
On screen.
Aye, sir.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
Can anything be done for him?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
I've never met a human woman.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
You know I do.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Yes.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
There is that.
I know.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.
I won't defend my life to you.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Why are you here?
Long ago.
I am.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Let's go.
Find her again.
None.
Silence, Romulan!
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
I don't see anything.
Sure.
Eh... yes.
It is beautiful.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Stay right there...
Elmo's...
About five miles back.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
When can we expect containment?
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
Okay...
Don't... don't do this... please...
Dashboard.
What are you doing?
Gas good?
You'll see.
I am...
My... husband.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
No.
Horses.
A baby is a new person?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
It was a mistake.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Yes.
On the radio they say it's good.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Where did you learn that?
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You're damn right I am.
I understand.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
My grandmother's rich.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
I did.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Was there visual contact?
Twenty-eight years.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Just not the eyes.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Fuck you.
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Forget it's there.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Damn right.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Thanks, Max.
Shutup a second!
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
I intend to.
Only way I could stand your ties.
Where's Faith?
You bet.  Did you like it?
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Coming with you.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
No idea.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Sure.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
How long does it last?  Oh.
Uh unh.
Just Lenny.
Aw, Mom!
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
That's right, Jan.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What's the bad news?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Winona.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
Yes.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
What's with the eyelids?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Another what?
What are you doing?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
Go ahead.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I don't believe this.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
Where's my watch? It's gone.
It explains a lot.
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
Don't be too harsh.
Sue Ann Hanson.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Oh.
What's up?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Yes, sir.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
I already have an employer.
Those were just fantasies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Yes, sir.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
I talked to him.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
It's over for you.
Shit.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
What do you drive?
What's that like?
Just like that?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
My pleasure.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
I'm a "Dorothy".
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Sorry?
Six years.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
Really?
Why didn't you call?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Goodbye. I lov...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Kinda.
I do. Good for you, man.
What'd you get?
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I just tested for one...
Go for it, man.
Oh boy.
Well, that's dumb.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
Sure.
Make someone bleed.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
What are you talking about? Vegas?
When?
You're crazy.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's go.
I know she's coming back.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
What?
Hold on.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She thought you were money.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
This version doesn't have fighting?
Yeah.
It starts at eight...
Minnie Pearl.
What?
She didn't notice.
What a surprise.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
They're a finesse team...
...It's on.
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
True.
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
Now go over there and get those digits.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it's on.
...it's definitely on.
...just be smart about it.
Our little baby's growing up...
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
An eye for an eye!
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Barzini.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
What percentages for my family?
Sure.
You understand him better than anyone.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I'll need him.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
You want him to stay in this country.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Mike!
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
Okay.  One minute.
We're all tired...
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
Mama, no.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael, I love you.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
And what do you want for Christmas?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Until the old man tells me different.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Cut it out.
Probably a year...
I do wish to be baptized.
Be patient.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Well, we ate everything without you.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Yes please!
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
No, still here.
Can you mix a martini?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
I love jazz.
This is so good of you.
What?
Copy out from here...
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
No!
Relax.
What club?
I thought you'd missed the train.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
That's good.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So tell me.
How?
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Sure.
Dickie?
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Hello Marge!
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
What?
I can explain.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Shut up! Shut up!
Why? When?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
No glasses.
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Excuse me?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Randall.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
You know what -- I am.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
You try. You try talking to her.
I give up.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
Does he stay with you here?
31 people.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over.
Huh?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
My name is Travis.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Oh. Who was that again?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
I'm getting a taxi.
Hello, Betsy.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
With who?
This is gotta be a game, right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Is he Italian?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
Could you see anything?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
You carry a piece? You need one?
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Easy.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Pittsburgh.
He looks like a killer.
He shoots dope too.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
My work may take me out of New York.
Why, thank you Travis.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
Damn straight.
You want to work uptown nights?
How's your driving record?
Age?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Your name Sport?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Yeah?
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
I'm a field agent.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
It's all I could think of.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
The cell, Mason.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Hi.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
How'd they get it inside?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Yeah...
I don't smoke?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I do.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Shhhhhh.
But what?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Harry, son.  Harry.
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Yes.
Anybody take it?
What.
The G-man?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I guess I did.
She's very pretty.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Exactly.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
It's wrong, Leo.
Luke didn't smoke.
Not any more.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
I taught you that.
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
No, I...
What?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Cat.
You bet, honey.
What exactly did you hear?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
No. Just a few hours.
Lovebirds.
How'd you happen to come here?
I suspected as much.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
No!
Well, I suppose...
Oh, I suppose so.
I don't think your mother would like that.
I know.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Darling, of course I do!
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I don't know, honey.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
The little Brenner girl.
It's Alice.
Right across the bay there.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Okay.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
We'll make our own fog.
They're back!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
I don't know.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Shhh. Shhh.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I started to say... inside...
Oh, thank you.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like me to go for her?
Not by the thousands.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Well, I...
I'm awfully sorry.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
Ahhh, but I know you.
We met in court.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
What made it...
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What for?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
How do you know Annie?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Oh. That. Rome.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
What do you want ?
Cheers.
Like what?
What?
What'll it say?
No, tell me.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
So they united.
Take wing!
It was like that yesterday.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Almost two a.m.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
Well, all right, but...
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Do you have any lovebirds?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Can't you please finish your drink?
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Good morning.
It is a pity.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Where can I find him?
Come in, boy -- come in.
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
I remember her.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You've no thought of going there?
It was a woman when we put her in.
Not yet.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
Afraid of what?
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
The heart pumps it.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I take no gifts from you.
I know --
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
You can get out.
I'm looking for my friends.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Yeah. I sure will.
Where the fuck did you come from?
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
Who are you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Good thing in a situation like this.
Nobody.
How can you die if you're already dead?
No! Why are you haunting me?
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's what Lauren would do.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
I know.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
You killed my daughter.
I do. Every day.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
He said he'd prove it.
No.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
That was my first question.
Would you care to be more specific?
I assure you such power exists.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Okay.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
What do you mean, dear?
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Yes -- I think so.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
About five months -- your months.
About 250 million of your miles.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I can judge only by what I see.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
May I see you for a minute?
Yes--?
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Remember those words.
I -- I thought you were--
You mean he has the power of life and death?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
That's right.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
Can't stand light?
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
The meanest!
Hey, take it easy.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
I will, David!
How do you know they're not?
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Sam, don't --
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
Closet monster!?
I told Max eight o'clock.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Whatcha doin' over here?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I better get cleaned up, then.
This is Michael.
Who, Laddie?
Okay.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
What's that smell?
I thought we were poor.
You've heard this story before?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
He's already gone to bed.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
But, Mom...
Mom!
Hi, Thorn.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
Okay.  Talk.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
No... no, everything's different now...
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
I was here first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Anybody sick?
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Have you come across Fuchs?
We'll see...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
Hell no.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
But...
What?
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
We ain't buying that.
What for?
What do you mean "you think so?"
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
I guess I'm the only one.
Nothing we can do about that.
That far?
You reach anybody yet?
Well, stick to it.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
I ain't going with Sanchez.
He's dead.
Can you think of any other tests?
Everything that's been missing.
Calm down and get in your position.
Then we go after him.
What for?
So what do you make of it?
Who else could have used that key?
I had an accident.
Where?
What happened?
No...
This is it?
What are you?
Morlocks --
I'm used to that.
It frightens you.
This way.
What do you mean?
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I won't leave you like this.
I will...
Alexander.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
No...
I'm a foolish man.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
A moonstone.
Holding you... again.
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
What?
How romantic...
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
What is it?
Why don't you come to our house instead?
Yes...
Thank you.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Good night.
Thank you.
You know this?
Go back to your own time?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Tell him to go away --
Imagine that.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
New Yorkers.
No...
I took a different route.
New Yorkers.
We choose to believe it.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
That's too bad.
You sure you know where to find one?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
He didn't either.
That's too bad.
Sure.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Why?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
[Beat] What?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
Yeah.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Yes.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
[Beat] I don't know.
Believe me, I know.
I never knew my father. Did you?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
I'll die either way.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
Who told you this?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Why?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
Where are you going?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Sure.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
Uh-huh.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
What?
Yes, baby?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
It's him.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
I'm a robber.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Yes.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Get the car.
Get the car!
West.  Left.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
What did Darryl say?
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Taking a shower.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Yeah.
What for?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Alright, Louise!
Let's get it over with.
You're right.
Now what what?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
You mean now or before?
I can see that.
Gosh.  It sure is.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
I believe you.
Yeah, you want it?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
Where?!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
All this for us?
What are you talkin' about?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Say you're sorry.
Grrrreat!
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
I'll try to be more careful.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Good-looking?
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Uh-huh.
Yeah feels like it.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Mints?
No.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
'That right?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Thanks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
No I can't.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
You found my car?!
Dumbshit.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Have you seen it?
Forget it. It was... fun.
Warren!
Who the hell's Woogie?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
What do you mean 'why'?
Same here.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
I never said that.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
That must make it tough.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Where's Puffy?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
You betcha!
He's dead.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Hi, Ted.
Thanks.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Huh...?
Bye, Ted.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
Time is of the essence.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
I know, I know...
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
That may be what they want us to think.
Jesus Christ...
You're my hero, Carl.
Rug samples.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Sioux Indian, right?
It ain't Geronimo.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Goodbye.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Go ahead.
That's right.
Let's see it.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Yes.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
His spiritual mother...
I don't see the connection.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
That's right. Turn around.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Come back?
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It's classified.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Where were you?
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
Used to what?
About as much as they think about killing me.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
Winston Churchill.
Are you really that brave?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
In that order?
Not to me.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
That's what I want.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
I was, later.
Well?
F-14's sir.
Yes sir!
What is he doing?
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
No! Now we're inverted!
Not anymore.
BREAKING LEFT!
Yawing right.
Well what?
Got you here.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Who's your pilot?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
What?
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
What'd you do?
The girl with the purple fingernails?
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Figured out what?
I think I can work it out on my own.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Tell me one thing.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Bad?
Yes sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
No bother.
I know.
He was by the book, all the way.
Over there man.
The Last Resort.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Why not?
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Definitely.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
No, sir.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Nice to meet you.
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
At Rekall.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Swallow this.
Where?
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Melina!
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
You went to Rekall, remember?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Let me buy you a drink.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Level 2.  Galleria.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Yeah, sweetheart?
Just think about it.
Oh God, Doug.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Doug...
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Bullshit.
How real does it seem?
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Hauser left me a note.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I used to model for 'em, why?
Aliens built it.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
I think I scared it!
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Nope, there!  That's one.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Has a lot of rain.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
The rifle.
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Right.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Yeah, Val.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Let's assume that it is.
I know about Esparza.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Let go of my hair.
Sustained.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Not necessarily...
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Of course.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
You really think that's what happened?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
"Have to"? No...
-- Yeah?
Roger Baron.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
...What do you mean?
-- Roger -- ?
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
...Okay...
"Painted"?
It's okay, Eddie.
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
It was self-defense.
See-cil.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Y-yes, sir.
This and that.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
That's big of you, Bob.
Argumentative.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
No? Then what did he say?
-- What trial?
That's right.
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
That's right.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
NO! GOD, NO...
I want you to kill for me.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Bobby...
I am going over here.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Did she have someone with her?
Was there an argument?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Teresa Banks.
Anything else?
And neither will I.
Someone else has it now.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Cole said she was 17.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
You didn't do your homework?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
No, you're the muffin.
No, you should forget about last night.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
What can I tell you?
Cause I like it.
I did? I didn't see anything.
But Bob isn't real.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Hiking?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Fish eyes?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What were you doing in my room?
Mom, take it easy.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
No.
Look at this finger here.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
As if I didn't know.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
I'm fine.
Yes.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
And no one will know the truth.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
No.
I... yes.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
I am seventy-four years old.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
You may step down.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Yes.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Yes... I... yes.
Well...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
'Code Blue'...
Yes.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
I understand.
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Still looking.
And what are you? A cop?
Yes. It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Isn't there something you...
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
No.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
How come you're calling me from...?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
And ask me what?
...fifty thousand dollars?
I'm going to see you get that chance.
He's not in, Sir.
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
That's for sure, Frank.
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Admittance form is wrong.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Yeah.
You use their witness.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
The broad has disappeared...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't want a mistrial.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
In New York?
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
What's he like?
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
Can you handle one of these?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
It's gone now.
I liked him.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us something.
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
So is the town, I notice!
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Welcome to California!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
So?
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
Oh my God...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Everything is not fine!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Bye.
Read me some?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Yeah...how'd you know?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Steady...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
You miss him.
I am about this.
Guilty.
I haven't forgotten.
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
Yes sir.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
What?
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
I just can't believe it.
What was that?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
Me either.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
That's not why he's sending me.
It was a bad dream...
Like this!
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
We all have problems.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Me too.
Look, I just better go.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
Jesus, you never told them?
Face what?
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
I don't know.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
No.
He's a big boy.
It has nothing to do with him.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
We'll think of something.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
About anything.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Sir.
I can't.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
I am accountable.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Why? He's right in the groove.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
You was in the Marines, huh?
You an indian?
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
What's that?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Used to.
No, of course.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Muchas gracias.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
I'm sorry.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Hasta siempre.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
What happened to him?
What's that, peanut?
Hell, peanut...
So?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Got anyplace special in mind?
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You certain?
Where?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Under a hundred.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
What's that?
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Went with Bobby.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
SAILOR!!!!
I'll bet.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Yes.
Yes.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Someone's gonna see us.
No...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
You heard right.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Well?...
Thanks...
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
She's a transvestite.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
He heard everything we were saying.
Just go around him.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
It's very convincing.
A little.
So I'm told.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I had to. Didn't I?
Yea, James.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Sure.
What'd he say?
That's a big book you're writing.
Hm.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Well done, James.
But James. I mean... How long?
Your aunt?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
What kind of dancer?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
I never said that.
In a minute. Get us a table.
I eat.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I think so... What about you?
Grady!
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Who does?
That good, huh?
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Is the thing -- is it over?
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
About the baby.
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
Why yes. How did you know?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Yes?
I don't know. It might be...
Sick.
Her husband.
Taking the long way home.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
No, I'm going ho --
I doubt it, darling.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
No shit.
Beautiful. How's business?
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
Is it because of Anna?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
You need a table.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Isn't it?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Sure.
Why not?
The mother sure has her hands full.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
Robin.
Cop.
I have no idea.
Got something to hide?
You can't talk to me like --
What?
I fell asleep.
Yes.
No.
I could take you downtown.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yes.
I count my blessings.
What?
Do you like it when he asks you?
Yes?
You think reflection is good.
I'm still thinking about it.
I don't need someone else.
We have a few more minutes.
I couldn't say.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
I don't.
What did you want to happen?
I want you to calm down.
I said I was sorry.
I'm relaxed.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
All right.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
I was six years old!
I feel... okay.
Me?
People without cars.
I thought you were a dyke.
What?
Yeah, they could.
What?
Not tonight.
I suffer from insomnia.
The worst?
Not ever?
What?
You're such an asshole.
No way that could just be seawater.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Not for long.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
What do you think he saw?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Yeah.  So sue me.
You noticed.
They'll come out after us.
I don't know, look around.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Tell me later.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
I can't... make it... podner.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
You already know what they are.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
At what?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But then when will we see each other?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
Who knows why they all left...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
To do what?
What do you mean by sensible?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Yes, we will.
Lady Patrizia!
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
You're kidding!
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Who told you this?
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Yes.
Love.
Oh, yes!
Oh, I know he does.
Oh, yes.
How were you sick?
Did it hurt?
And what did you do?
Where did the baby come from?
Where'd it come from before that?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Then let's talk about something else...
Anything.
I can't have them any more.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No, but I can never tell her that.
She'd get angry.
Yes.
She...
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
I'm afraid.
It came out of me.
No.
Because I was afraid.
May I open my eyes now?
I ate.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you think it's there for?
What do you do?
I don't know which one
Yes.
Who?
Yes.
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Agnes who did you see?
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
You got to be crazy.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
What about Roger? He's free.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
The one up on the third floor?
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Yes.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
I haven't a clue.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
I am not with the Inquisition.
What's your opinion?
That's ridiculous...
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
And what happened?
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
Aquittal.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
Yes.
The woman's health is at stake.
You just said...
And what has that to do with it?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
I'd love one.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Become?  One is born a saint.
Of course.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
Why would I lie?
The scandal...
No!
Then she's a liar.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Are you now?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah.
The police station.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
Bag-snatcher.
No. I don't.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
I don't care.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Ah well. Eh, look!
He's sulking again.
You crawler.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Follow your impulse.
Come here.
Well, what happened?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Something like that.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
Yes.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Is she?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
What?
Me!
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ...
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Don't dramatise.
Why do you always use your left hand?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Shall I?
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
You wouldn't!
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
No, I'm not.
I knew I could rely on you.
Y'what?
Don't exaggerate.
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
And they want me?
Is that you, Roby?
Hell, we're equipped --
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
... I don't know...
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Where the hell are we?
That's what I'm going to do.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Is it solid?
Looks like a derelict.
God I'm hungry.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Has the hull been breached?
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
That way.
Right.
Here, let me try.
I kind of like it.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Careful, don't get under it!
I'll come with you.
What do you mean?
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Still unconscious?
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Good!  That's good!
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
No.
We're not going anywhere.
I think it's fizzled out.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Thanks for the thought.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Who knows?
Sun will be down in a minute.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Close...
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Engine room, what happened?
Any microorganisms?
What killed it?
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Even simple.
Food-storage room!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Right now let's keep it closed.
By eating our food supplies.
So the next step should be --
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Yeah... I forgot.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
I'll get you out of there.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Yeah...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Is it dead?
Shit.  When?
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Nooooo!
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What?
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Only six?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Agreed.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Yes. I do.
Just some coffee.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
I'm in love with Lloyd!
You have no right to say such things!
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I never intended you to be.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
A dull cliche.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
What?
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
She's a girl of so many interests.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
- guilty.
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Who?
Now don't get carried away-
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Are you proud of me, Bill?
Is that what you want me to be?
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
Now you want an argument.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
Don't be dense. The party.
Miss Harrington...
I - I guess I fell asleep.
What for?
Probably not.
What report? To whom?
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Of course.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
There can't be very much-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Something most important you can do.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
'Remembrance'.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
I had no idea you knew each other.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Really, Eve? Why?
The heave-ho.
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
I'm so happy you're happy.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
With tears.
In a minute...
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Such as?
Margo!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Not much.
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
Too bad.
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Answer my question!
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
The fucking New York Times.
--you do?--with access to records?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
And I'm a Republican.
When?
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
--I know, I know--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I haven't said anything--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
11:30.
Night.
--Howard Hunt?
Well of course.
I've got a lot of energy.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--what?--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
Which people?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
Go on.
I don't know titles.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Mitchell knew then.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Howard Hunt here.
Good God!
--I'm Woodward.
It may never come out.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
When so ordered.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
...okay...
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Pardon me?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.
Uh-huh.
No idea.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
You mean...and orgasm?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
But --
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Went home to shit.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
I'm not going.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
After getting laid?
You've got something going?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Strip?
Oh no.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
You think so?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
I don't know.  How do you?
Yeah.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Once, in church, dude.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I'm such a loser.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
I think we're falling in love.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
AHHHHHHH!
No it isn't! You're dead!
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
You'll never get the chance.
Sure. Don't you?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Oh no... no....
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus...
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Andy? Andy is that you?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
You fucking liar!
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
How to read.
I know, but I had to because . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
You must have.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
You shouldn't have pushed us!
It's the best fork of all
Sad?
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
I'll never let go!
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
Rasputin!
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
Remove him at once.
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
Promise me she'll have her home.
And tell me that she's happy.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Alvy Singer over here!
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Who are you?
It's okay.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Well, why not?
Tsch.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Well, stop listening to him.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
M'm.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Hey, that was last year.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Okay.
Okay, that's good.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
Yeah, I know.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Well...
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Fifteen years, yeah.
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Good? I was-
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
You are extremely sexy.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Mine.
It relaxes me.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Who cares? Who cares?
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Yeah?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Will it change your wife?
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
It was just great!
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
It's for my complexion.
W-w-whatta you mean?
Holy cow!
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Thing?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Why are you so hostile?
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Tell him.
Hey.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
You're crazy!
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Right, Max. California, Max.
We can show her the schoolyard.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Look, uh...
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
And... uh-
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
She was stealing.
SO?
She was going through my pocketbook!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
I don't know. I don't know.
I was very charming.
A long time.
It's the way they do things.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Absolutely.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
And how's the diva doing?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
He's allergic.
Why would she care?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
When does he graduate high school?
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
She left a note.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
You have?
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Forget it, Judy.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Not as a rule.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Anytime, sport.
We've only been over this how many times?
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
He's directing now.
I'm ready.
Happy anniversary.
Hardly...
Through the sweats or not?
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Well he can't have gone far.
Otis!!!!
Otis!
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't push me away.
Don't do this.
It's a Calder.
He's my favorite.
Ah...
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Hm.
I will treasure this.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
I like you.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
I'm sure you understand.
Why?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Not at all.
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Yeah.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Oh great.
You don't know she's a bitch.
Like your business managers?
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
What does that mean?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
I never like to talk about my work.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
I don't mind...
Evie has a little something for you.
And here they are!
I hope they're watercolors!
Hm.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Right...because every ant's important!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
You -- you think I'm right?
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Oh no...
A <u>few</u>?
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Yes...he's wonderful...
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Superior numbers, kid!
Oh, no, sir!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
Why are we so successful?
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
I can't think of any.
You're a real buddy.
Yeah.  How much?
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Sheldrake?
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
That's me.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
What time does the show go on?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Cheers.
I thought so.
No -- I like it.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
You don't want me here --
Baxter.
They had to pump it out.
A cemetery?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
I don't want to talk to him.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Cheers.
I don't?
Fine. How's your eye?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Gas?
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Mine?
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
What do you mean, sorry?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
You?
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
It's regulations.
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
The party's over.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
I wasn't trying.
Handle what?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Stop that, Fran.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
He wouldn't.
Sssssh.
Go where?
Oh -- oh!
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
Esprit de corps --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Fat. That's real fat.
Yes, sir --
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
I know.
Yeah, I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Shot himself. What for ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
I'll go with him --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Boss left.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
I got bored in Saigon.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
I met him.
Who?
I'm Kurtz.
You know you're right.
Yeah.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Which one's the Colonel's?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
When?
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
That's me.
Why did they attack us?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes.
Right now -- I am.
23   CONTINUED:
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
89   CONTINUED:
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
I just want this over with.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
168  CONTINUED:
Keep back.
26   CONTINUED:
28   CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
It's exactly what you meant.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Come here...
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
That's my line.
My home is here.  With you.
A daughter in Oregon.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
That's right.  You're not.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
You know Meyerling?
Yeah?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Nothing personal.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Fuck you.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
They'll have to come right past us.
Go ahead.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I've got Jews at my table.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
What's with the dark?
How do you know about my mother?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Is there another way to see it?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Welcome.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
It was a mistake.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I'll take care of myself --
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Two years ago...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Think white and get serious.
Wait here.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Well, I can't reach them.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
How're you doing?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Okay, then.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Oh, my gosh.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Never a break. Never.
This stuff is pointless.
Another place where?
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Tachlinkov.
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Bain!
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Know what?
I know.  It was a joke.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
The contract?
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Another contractor.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
We don't have a choice.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Just Electra?
It's not the same, is it?
Where you wanted to be?
Jesus -- why?
You were like a boy genius?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Why?
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Several.
Why not?
Yes.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Okay.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Thank you.
Transmits and receives.
Fine.
Okay.  Then what?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
That means you won't have a gun.
We split the money?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Yes.  Here I am again.
No.
So?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Did he explain how this happened?
What?
Why?
It can be.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Honestly?
Why?
I'm not normal.
Right.
Oh, God.  I see it!
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
All the time.
Why not?
A dime.
Anything.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
A coke, if they have it?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
What did the beer cost?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
That makes you an expert I guess.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
'cause you stink of booze.
But how did the wall get here?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
That bad?
Some deal you did there!
Sure I'm sure!
Do you know the way?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
So am I.
Regards to Her Majesty.
Yeah, maybe.
You used to read.
No way Doug, I can't.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
But I love you!
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Good, great....Dobchay!
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
What is bail?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Am I invited?
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
It's Josh's.
You may use my office.
Yeah.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No problem, is it at your place?
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
-- I like the car I have.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
He wants to talk to you.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
York Ave.
Demented.
Me.
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
My relationship with God is my own.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Healthy as can be.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
It's not.
When I have something to say.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
What?
I wanted this to be a date.
Not possible.
What would you do up here?
Where's the one you're building?
I don't care.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
Yes.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
No.
I have expectations, too.
No. I want what's best for you.
That won't be possible.
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Yes. You?
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
When do I get time for me?
Scalene?
What do you want, Biff?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, thanks...
But he didn't ask me.
Coming, Eileen...
How are you?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Not a holocaust --
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
What's this all about?
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
What if you lost your keys?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
Professor, be serious, would you?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
You did what?!?
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
What do you call this?
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Sure,.
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
He said not to tell.
Okay.
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Thirty aught six.
They're okay.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Thanks.
Yeah? Why not?
What's your friend's name?
It's okay.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Sure.
Well, stop the world.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Okay.
Don't ask me.
But it would hurt.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
Just looking.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
I don't want a steak.
Excuse me.
Positive?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
No.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yes?
Yes.
No.
Stay as long as you like.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Wanta sue me?
Who're you?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Then that's it!
They're stealing my chopper!
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Arachtoid.
What? How do you know that?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
She was killed, Penny.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Flying to Cambodia.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Hello.
...Who is this?
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Garland, it's me.
I...
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
Well... actually, no Bill...
Ever act?
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Who?
Well I...
He's a great writer 
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
To do what?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
And I could tell you some stories 
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?
Seen a doctor?
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Lou.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Mr. Lipnik.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Nine days  Tuesday 
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Mr. Lipnik, please 
When did you start drinking again?
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Thanks.
Bring 1976 up.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's been three months.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
She said what you said she'd say.
I thought you quit.
Nilsen.
I don't need any help.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Are you arresting me?
I quit.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
That's right.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Don't get too cocky.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What if I call you Nicky?
What's it about?
I'll meet you there.
Make love to me.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I never have before.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Come over here and tell me no.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Yes I am.
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Were there ever any suspects?
Nilsen?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
What is it you got between you?
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Yeah.  I know.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
What was it?
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
No.
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Are you vice?
Did you check all four years?
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, I met her already.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Do you still love her?
You should talk to him about this.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
Sure.
What?
Should there be?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Out?
Yeah..
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Hi Gina.
I ain't John Henry.
Good. What do you have?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
You're your own baby.
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
How is he?
What's his name?
You only want one Big Mac?
Hi.
Thanks
Have a Mac.

Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I'll make you another one.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I need this?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
No, actually I feel worse.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Yes and no ...
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Weird, huh?
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Your blood, Max.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
One way to find out?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Dad!  Save yourself!
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Right here, sir.
That, sir, does not compute.
Coming on line now, sir.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Divide and conquer.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I hate being lectured.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Surf's up.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I wish I knew.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
He ran away?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
What?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
And you are?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
What's wrong?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
Banzai.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
What?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
You do know. Try.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
...You gonna kill me?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Here. Get a good seat.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
I won't let you have it.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
What are you talking about?
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Yeah. Deja vu.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
Your face smells like a foot.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
About Charles...
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Right first time.
Uh ... yes ...
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Excuse me.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Yes, isn't he.
I beg your pardon?
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Ahm....
Quite right, sir.
What makes you say that?
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
How the hell should I know?
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Of course he is.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Yeah, we should party.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Me first?
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Cool, huh huh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Uh...
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Cut the power!
That's better. Yes?
Agent Hurley...
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
How's your arm?
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Won't?  Or can't?
They make gypsies look good.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
He might have hurt somebody.
What makes you think she likes me?
Just a hunch.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
I got an A!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Our cemetery?
About what?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
I want to get in.
No, dummy.  Two.
Good girrrl!
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?

That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
... sheets.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
I saw some ghosts.
I'm sorry already.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
... Straight out?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Thank you, Robert.
In a day or two, yes.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
No. I like this attic very much.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I agree.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
I like to watch. This is fine.
No. I like it here.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Good night, Eve.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Thank you, Eve.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
Hello, Sid.
No. I'm not busy.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
... I see.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
I agree.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Yes. I would like to do that.
Yes.
I can't write.
Yes.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
It's very sore.
I agree.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Is his back feeling better?
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
No, I do not have any of those.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... Oh, really...
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Right, Chief.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Yes, sir.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Thank you, Colonel.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Okay.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Hi.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
What?
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
You bastard.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
That... was... no... simulation.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Schwartz.
Yes?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
But I think I have another plan.
Why are you being like this?
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fork ah did?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
One hour.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Do you mind?
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Lotte called me.
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Derek Mantini!
What want ye, girl child?
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Yes ma'am.
Ya think?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
No, let her rest.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
I don't know him that well.
You was friends.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
Just me.
It ain't what you think.
She was only-
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Paul D.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
It's the LeBaron.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Nothing.
That is for the urn.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
I am the Walrus.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
That fucking bitch!
What the fuck is he talking about?
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Well--
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Uh-huh.
Far out.
Nancy's pretty good.
I see.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
In the briefcase?
Separate incidents?
Far from it.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Thank you.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
What do you do for fun?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
But he's--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Huh?
Yeah.
It's your roll--
What the fuck is going on there?
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
What about the toe?
The bulk of the series.
Not exactly a lightweight.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Dude?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about?
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
He can't walk, Walter!
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
Then what's...
Wha. . . Donny--
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
You're a fuck, Walter!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Minutes.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Fry 'em.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
I want to see the sun rise.
Sounds like a plan.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Then who does he work for?
Not alone.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
I don't know about this, man --
Human?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
You experimented on your own, son?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Two so far.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Take him.
Who is LaMagra?
But I just got here --
I'm sorry, I --
Preventive medicine.
What do you see here?
He will.
How can you tell?
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
You get used to the darkness.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Cancer.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I'm not leaving without you.
You're a week early.
I was afraid that might happen.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Hey, folklore--
Bullshit! Talk!
Yes.
Trying to find the energy.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Mrs. Leavitt--
Let's talk to your husband--
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
That's a joke?
--Nick!!
--whatever; that's her.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
--Cotter's--
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
--no, what's wrong with you?
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
No.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
No idea--goddamitt!
Next time try putting on shoes--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--turn the camera off--
I am.
Look over there.
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
One of the printers.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
No. I don't think so.
Then I have no idea.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
He'll never know.
That's why she kills children.
Get some more beer.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
Whatever.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
Who <u>is</u> this??
What happened to my Dad??
No.
No, I--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Yeah? What happened?
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Abby--
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Isn't that what you want?
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
What?
See, I never knew that.
...Hell.
Back where?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
...What kind of fish?
Has Ray come in yet?
What.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Tuesday.
What?
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Okay.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
No. not at all.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Then, shut up!
Alright, suit yourself.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Well.
Never before this.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
Then don't talk about killing.
No.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Sure I do.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I want you to stay with me.
Go where?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
There ya go.
Terrible. boring.
That's too bad.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'll drink to that.
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Okay, okay. Bye.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Okay, Sandy.
You want to go talk to him?
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Go ahead.
Do you want the car?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah, I know.
I'll get a coat for her.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
He what?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Baby, you didn't have to come.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
What?  Yeah, sure.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
It's your grass.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Yeah.  She told me.
For calling you a homo.
What?
I don't want to talk about it.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
I just got released five minutes ago.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Today.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Oh, I see.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Actually, it was three.
Un sapo?
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Power?
And Diego?
Yeah.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Tough spot.
Not mad.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
No.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
What about him?
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
Figured what out?
I like fire.
I said, I've seen it before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Better than you.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
How are you doing?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
California.
Where are you going?
You swear?
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Very nice.  I'll take it.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
The strike is a success; but ...
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
It's true.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
Here?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Why?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
You get his statement?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
No.
Six years.
Yes.
Yeah.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Yes.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
You called him?
No.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Yes -- he did.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
He video taped you.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Why'd you come here?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Of course.
It's only the beginning.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Why?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
Yes.
Where have you been?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Why did you lie to me?
I'm not.
Why didn't you come to me?
It was a place to start.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
We were here two Christmases ago.
SO!
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Why are there two deeds here?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
'82.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh, yes.
They got heat in Michigan.
I'll get right on it.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Oh, that'll be nice.
That's it.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
And clean.
I think so.
I feel so embarrassed.
But I... We don't even know each other.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
No. I'll do them later.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
No. But I love them just the same.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
I want you to come.
Sure.
Why?
Near the church.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Well, what is this?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
WHY?
Then he can move! People move!
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Frannie.
I'm going to miss you.
What's she like?
Cremated?!
Apparently just before her death.
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Yeah?
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Damned if I know.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
That's some terrible shit.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
What?
Hush, baby.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
All the more reason I should be here.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
You were just a kid.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
What building?
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Shit, that was fast.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Potential toxic dump site.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Ours!
Just admit it, Caesar.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
There's no time.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
The hell I can't!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
He can't kill you --
You need the money just like we do.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Yes, I understand.
Pretty good, sir.
It's all right, sir.
Oh, right.
Where's the fucking money?
No.
What?  They ain't there?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
I knew it.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
He said you lost something.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
What do you want?
Why?
...  yes.
Basically.
I'm already in your bed.
Shit, here we go.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
Mickey?
He hung it up.
To let it dry.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Trust me, Violet.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
Pop?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Who?  Who came?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Thanks.
Did you?
Yes.
That'd be great.

-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
Nothing.  It's just not there.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
I can't believe I slept.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
Who paid the bill?
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
Not really.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
I'm sorry.
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
Hang on...
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
What have you done to my flat?
... yer ducts.
What? You mean you've got ...
What do I have to do.
You don't have to sing it.
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
No, no ... I did that...
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Yes, thanks.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
You got the wrong man.
He's a freelance subversive?
Why?
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
You're the only person I can trust.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
Jack ...
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
What?
You're joking.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
No you're not!
Yes.
Your face ... are you hurt?
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
You are good to me Sam.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
You haven't switched it on.
I won't be held responsible.
I'm sorry but ...
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Er, yes ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Central Services.
Have you got one or haven't you?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
She say she in great pain.
He looks like a cop.
Sleeping in the back.
Got a beer?
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Just take it easy.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Yes.
You look so different.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Frank.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
She's no whore, Marcus.
It's coming.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
A medical miracle.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Why?
Let me think.
Okay, whatta I do?
That's ridiculous.
Frank!
I'm not hungry.
What?
Used to be my partner.
You sure?
No way!
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
What's wrong with it?
What?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
They booted me out of Washington.
Why?  What did they do to you?
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Yes.
I don't like the word gay.
Ravenous homosexual.
A half hour in the lobby.
Why do you say that?
Good night.
Eleven and a half.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
We can cut back at the end.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Okay, great -- good luck.
People phoned in.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
This isn't friendship.
Really?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Wipe me out?
No.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Yes, there is.
I spent a fortune on this.
We could...
Bobbie, please.
Bad manners.
Okay.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Okay, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
It's not.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Fill for a second.
Yes, sure.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
What do you mean clean?
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Well, what is it?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Uh-huh.
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
That's yes?
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
A picnic?
Right back to you.
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
I'm going home!
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I didn't finish talking to you!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Whaddya mean?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
A thing I made.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
There there...
Walter!  Jeez!
Yes Walter.
Bye!
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
That means you like me!
What are you trying to say?
No! I want to talk about it now!
Why not?!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Forget it.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
I admit it.
I know, man.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Have a seat -
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Yeah and what would I say?
Put it down, Walter.
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Yeah I did.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Huh?!!!
You are?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Here here!
I thought you didn't respect money!
Then let me give you something then...
Gee.  Thanks.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Let's move out!
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
You look like shit, Benny.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Down there.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Don't tread on the earth?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
It's the news, Buffy.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Jealous?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
You guys are thrashed.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Not exactly.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I'll back that up.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I know.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
For the dance.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I should have known.
Get away from me!
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
To bring you... your birthright.
Wait!
In Virginia.
China.
Cramps?
It's true.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
They were vampires?
Oh.
Try to pay attention.
Fine.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Don't start with me again.
Buffy...
Five.
It isn't important.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
They don't even have Dolby.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Thanks.
You're having a fling with him?
Hi.
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
I don't understand.
Oh, baby!
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Does Jeffrey know?
Oh, please.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
What?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
I know what it is.
Yes I do...
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I won't be needing these anymore.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
We all deserve to wear white.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
So...Wanta make love?
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I can do that, too.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You got a live arm there.
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
How?
Gimme that.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
I won't have to.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
What?
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Crash, shut the door.
Love to--
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
We're eight and sixteen.
...and one helluva guy.
Looking for Crash Davis.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What?
Hello, Senator.
You were never my guest?!
Liar.
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
I was in the building!
This is a very auspicious occasion.
But what happens when they do find out?
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I don't know.
Matter of fact...
They payin'?
Ginger.
You mean, I have your permission?
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Hey.
No, I don't wanna come -
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
I lost control?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Hey, she came to talk...
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
I -
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Seven o'clock.
And they were usually right.
Good to meet you.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
Yeah, refill'd be great.
No, Ace.
Ace, listen to me.
Why is she eight pounds over?
No. Just stop everything.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Certainly.  Senator.
Who's this?
Right away. Okay?
See you, Ginger.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Thank you.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
It's nice isn't it?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Yeah.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You can trust me.
Okay.
No, you don't.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Pretty serious.
And...
He needed some clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
I threw it away.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
You understand? What? Let you go?
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I wouldn't do that...
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
I'm not -
Not gonna let me in?
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
But it was just mine.
Eight children!
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
I really think you're -
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
You're firin' me?
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Green?
So, you're a righty?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
I didn't give 'em the m-
Thanks, Nick.
Shut your mouth!
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Hi. Good.
Well, I've been busy.
Sam?
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Pitch-black?! It -
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Yeah?
Nicky, I did -
I did - I didn't -
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Carmine's gone.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh?
How are you?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
That's enough now!
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
All right?
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
I don't -
Okay.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
I did what you told me to.
All right. Be careful.
Okay, yeah.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Come on!
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Here.
'Go! Go! Go!'
You're driving me nuts!
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
I took care of everybody.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Fuck you!
Charlie M.
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
You sure?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Mr. Chairman -
Oh, sorry -
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
It may be time to get the police involved...
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
You've seen me...
You can't get away with..
Spear.
Men, huh?
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Actually, yes.
Not too cool...
But I'm blind.
Yes, Mother. Dear.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Don't you have children?
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
You could've killed us.
Why would I do that?
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Or relieve me of it later.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
It's taken care of.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
A price on everything.
That makes two of us.
No.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Don't say that.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Are you okay?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Your husband?
Put the man back on.
I can't do it.
Why can't it be her?
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
You're going to let them get away with this?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Do you have to point that?
A typical fuck-up.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Why are we stopping?
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Got a phone in that van?
It's your call.
I still don't see you.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
The fuck I will!
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
How do you know?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Mind if I have a look?
Thanks.
So who's he?
Did he?
Nice.
Hi.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
What?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
You can't leave me then, can you?
No, I didn't --
Like what?
Must be.
Maybe.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
What do you think?
Is this an obsession of yours?
No...
Dil --
Give it over, Dil --
Never said a truer word.
Make it up to me, then.
Absolutely.
Delirious.
Not at all, honey.
Not here.
You could say that.
I can't.
More than that.
What?
Look on it like a honeymoon.
I'm going home!
Jimmy?
Don't go like that.
You knew which man?
You knew my Jody?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Okay.
He asked me to see were you all right.
I like you, Dil --
Yes.
Anything.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
I promise.
The Metro.
Yes. Say hello to Col --
Stop it, Dil --
Carnations.
Horny bastard.
He's all right.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Someone's got to do it.
Leave me alone, Jude.
What do you mean?
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what if you don't?
And do you know why?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
Just a girl.
Aye, I do, Peter.
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
So, what do I look like?
I can smell her perfume.
Can't we take it off?
No. It's the truth.
Do what?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
And you know the funny thing?
No.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Suppose you could say that.
Don't I know it.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
What the fuck were you doing here?
You could have said no.
Give us a break.
My special friend.
It's as simple as that?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
If they kill me --
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I told you not to talk that way --
Stop it --
You won't run.
Got to catch me first --
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
Why do you think I brought you here?
You're going to look for him -- now?
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Reggie -- listen to me --
We? You mean you're --?
Agent.
So that was it.
His -- real -- ?
Oh, I see.
But I don't have it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
But --
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Barely, yes.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Me? Why me?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Brian.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You'll wreck your raincoat.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
That's the idea.
It's all right with us --
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Come here.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Okay.
You did.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm sorry.
I dare you.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
How much is it worth?
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
In money.
Here's ten.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
The kid said --
Tell me what?
I know.  I'm sorry.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Yes.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Charles is.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Good night.
Be careful, Peter.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
The man you had the fight with.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
I believe what he said.
What are you talking about?
Don't put yourself out.
Yes?
Wha -- what do you want?
Ça alors! From Charles?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
What's the matter, chérie?
He took care of Charlie for us.
As fucking if.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Daddy you scared me!
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
It can't be.
No I wasn't.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
This will relax her.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
I can.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
What are you doing here?
I'm sure you should have failed.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
You think you're my sister?
Why?
You eventually have to talk to him.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
OK. increase the peace.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
FINE. Are you?
What?
No.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Stag?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
What?
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Yeah.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Pretend we're just another couple.
Hi princess.
Yes?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
And the police did nothing?
His mother's side.
I got to go.
I'm worried about someone.
No, you keep one.
Ok.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Yes. Unfair to me.

Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
We do need your truck.

Hey, actually...



You have my word on that.
You'll kill us all!
Is this stool taken?
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Almost quaint.

That's right.
A ruler?
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
It doesn't hurt.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Do you know him?
His girlfriend?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
How did you find out?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
What is it?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Plus what I owe you?
You sure this is okay?
Jake, listen.
Thank you...
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How are you, Lou?
Summer colds are the worst.
No.
No.
You accusing me of extortion?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
What for?
I guess not.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
But he wasn't killed.
How did you find out?
You mean you don't know where you were?
No, not for that one.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Oh.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
You bastard.
She's not tied up!
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Aren't you coming back with me?
...That's not what I meant.
Where's the girl?
I want to see her.
What did you do that for?
What the hell is this all about?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Back to Mexico.
How about a plane?
Okay...
I'm all right.
But, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
You'll find one of those people.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.

Yes...
Never.
What about the water?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
...Yes of course.
May I ask what this is regarding?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yes.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
No...
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Why? What do you mean?
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Elena. My name's Elena.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
No...
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Two cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
He made an awful lot of money.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Certainly not.
Yes.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Certainly not.
September the ninth?
Are they standing for me?
There is no news big enough.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
We've got a nice plant here.
Has he said when he'll finish?
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
It can wait.
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Hmm!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
No, you're not.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Can't say, sir.
What're you going to do, Charlie?
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
Yes?
Charlie -
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
Charlie!
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
It's a letter from her lawyers.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
I had a toothache.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Am I sure?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
I take it she likes the guy.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
I feel nauseous.
Very dramatic, I thought.
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
But can we date?
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Um... okay.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Oh God...
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
Yes.
Annoying Customer.
No, thanks.
You called Caitlin again?
What do you two fight about?
That's cheating?
Oh, my God.
That girl was vile to you.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Oh yeah.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
You know what I just watched?
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Yeah.
And you figured it out?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
The milkmaids?
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
You've got a customer.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
An embarrassing way to die.
Bible truth.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Listen to you.
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Why should I loan you my car?
If you must.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Because I'm here.
I'm happy.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
Could be.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
What time did you get to work today?
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
I don't have love handles.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
I'm not dealing.
I should start.
It's not my store.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
He died in the bathroom.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
We were going to start again, I think.
Meaning?
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
So I'm told.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Bunch of savages in this town.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why do you say that?
Really?
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Including you?
Including you; yes.
Please calm down.
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Um. Thirty-seven.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
I don't want Caitlin...
I don't want to go back with her...
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
That's tight. Solid.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Because he's out of shape.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
How long you gonna be here?
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Twenty bucks.
How yo doin', Gabe!
What?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Fuck you.
I admit, I can be bought.
I copy.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You're getting warmer!
Hey, fuck you.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I did what I thought was right.
Give him the money.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
We spent a night there one night...
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
You couldn't.
He doesn't want my help.
Can't do it.
You know me, I'm a night person.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Yeah?
Never
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
I won't do it.  No way.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
How far?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
There is.
Tucker and Walker.
There.  You blind?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
There, what's that place?
Then go fetch.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Of course. Food alright?
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Keeping fit then?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Murder, sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
But it was horrible.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Prison custody?
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Big case?
Sure thing.
Max...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
In my office?
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
'Fraid so.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
Of course.
Then let's have it.
So?
I don't know...
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
So?  It was a random thing.
Pick me up in five minutes.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Twenty-four minutes.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Max.
You always stutter?
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
South Central.
Yes.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Who was he?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Why?
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Yes, Max?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Oh, I'm captivated.
Jazz.
Don't start.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
Why?
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
No, not just that.
That's what you said...
Who?
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Geronimo?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
You bit someone's nose off?
Switch the charts.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
As opposed to?
What is it with you and the space program?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Believe you about what?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Never heard of him.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
How is it possible?
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Okay, I will.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Where are we going, Jerry?
They'll trace it.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Top pocket...  Go on.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Now she tells me.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
The truth shall make you free.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
You do recognize it then?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
Wasn't my idea.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
What do you mean?
What do you suggest?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Ellie?
What?
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
With me.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
What would you have me say, David?
Thank you?
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Well --
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
No primer.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
You want to classify prime numbers?
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
And a hundred mile airspace.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Is that your official response?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
Can you help us?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
No.  Please.
That's my girl...  Lights.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
The systems integration site.
Peter Valerian.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
Ellie --
You too.
Like it or not.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Something like that.
You're willing to die for this.
What'd you think?
I don't follow.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
It's late.  We should go back.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
The final countdown.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
In other words.
Meaning...
But --
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
I got two years.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
You steal a car?
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes, Boss.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
She's got him! You hear that?
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That fool. That damn fool.
Cuter.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Well, how far didya get?
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
What are you talking about?
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
None of your fucking business.
Fear of what...
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
But </u>alive</u>!
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You're calling me a crank?
I think this is number three...
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That's no surprise.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
Why should I trust you?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Well, thanks.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Go and look for a note.
I know, baby.  I know.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
You came in there with this attitude...
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
What about her arms?
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
That's always your privilege, sir.
Yessir.
You're damn right I do.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
Or the F.B.I.?
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
And her husband? What was he?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
One of your suitors?
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
Yeah, and a dimple.
What?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I miss Beast a lot, too.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
I'd have to see it on.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Ecru.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Not even if it's something positive?
Letty.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
I wasn't hungry.
Paul.
Very romantic setting.
Good God.
Exactly.
Don't be ridiculous.
Really?    Me too.
Break up?    They wish.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
No way.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Tell the doctor.
Lie down.
Your family just met me.
Michael, I...
But I do.     I love you, too.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
So, it's over?
I better make a list.
It's sex time.
I'll see you tonight.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Why'd you tell?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I don't feel like going to work today.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
You just need to get more organized. L
That's a big question.
Especially this last year.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
I've met someone else.
I love him.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
I'll float you.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
They don't have a murder weapon?
You'll never get out of the city.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
You're there now?
It's Daniel.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
Half the tapes.
Thank you.
I know they won't be home tonight.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
I'm not any closer than you are.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Do I?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
Has to be.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
You haven't answered my question.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
You better.
Man, I can get anything.
How much?
Fine.
We had a deal.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Good song though.
The Holiday Hotel.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
Relax. It will be fine.
Uh huh.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
Yeah, I dig him.
I know where she went.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Oh, you think?
Where is it, Sophie?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Something like that.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No.
It's not your fault.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
A little?
A car.
It's for you.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
What's it to you?
I owe you nothing.
Don't bother.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Really?
You're probably right.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Then you have no use for the sword.
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
My comb!
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
But Wudan does not accept women.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
We must avenge mother!
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Who ever made that.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
I'm buying.
I saw it, too.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
I should be trying to stop you.
It's only a flesh wound.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
I dabble.  May I?
Mister Funboy lives there?
No.
A remembrance.  A closure.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I don't know you...
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
I can see her.
Does it hurt?
Go away.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Kill a dead guy?
No shooting.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Annette Harrison.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Junior.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
You talking to me?
What'cha reading?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Refreshing.
You implied it.
Why not?
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
Without question.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Wait, don't hang up.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Yes it does.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Yes.
Yeah, me neither.
What are you saying?
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
I'm sorry about that.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Where did you say she's from?
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
No.
You'd do that for me?
It's Kathryn.
I don't know.
No.
You think he'll like it?
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
I'm taking a shower.
I know.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Baby?  Right on time.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Who is this?
Likewise I'm sure.
Racist piece of shit.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Okay.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Cecile.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
So what went wrong?
It was... Fantastic.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
I want to fuck.
No, I'm not.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I accept. Now get out.
And if I don't?
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Do you know where she is?
Yes, you already did.
Nope.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Yes, darling.
At the old house with the voice.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Yes, daddy.
Yes, daddy.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
Voices from an old dark house!
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Because she is my friend.
I don't know yet.
I can not tell you.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Whenever you want.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
This is more fun than just pretend.
Oh, please!
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
That's the clever way to do it.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
No, thank you.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Good.
My daughter died long ago.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Can we get some service here?
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Nearly four.
No it's mom.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Frida, grab that red one.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Okay. I guess so.
I think he called you beautiful.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
You should have seen it erect.
No.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I think I already have.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
No. I won't let you do that.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
Starving.
They say sex is great for cramps.
I really gotta pee.
Yeah right... You better go.
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Are you following me?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
Worse than this?
We didn't have sex.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
Take some allergy medicine.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
I told you she was innocent.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
The park dude was missing an arm.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
What makes her think that?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
He's seriously disturbed...
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I see...
Patricia Crenshaw.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
What?  Who has?
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Right.
No more than the usual.
You're kidding?
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
) Listen, you little...
Yeah.
Fine.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I was a senator, you know.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
He was only doing his job.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
Choices?
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Extend things?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
What?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
What?
What?
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
What about it?
Certainly.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
No... They don't kid.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Anybody would have done it.
Oh... Okay.
You have a lot of secrets.
You find people jobs?
I know.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
We're working on it.
What about the intro?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Look.
Gasparilla?
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Maybe.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
I don't think they're in school.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Except sex.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I'm sorry.  I, we
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
You are?  She's glad I called!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Huh?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
Yawp!
YAWP!
Okay.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
You have another choice.
Then you can help him.
Good luck.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Yes sir.
Todd Anderson.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
What is that supposed to mean?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Quiet.  I have to think.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Yea, art thou there?
We have to make it to the third deck...
He's the owner...
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
How soon can we get up and running?
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Dead.
Shut up!
That's where my boat's moored.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
You hear that?
I don't know...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
A meat locker.
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
Forget them...
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
Joey...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
A little to the left...
One whistle... Start the engine...
Nothing.
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
I know...
Those are mine!
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
It's Nick!
I know, but...
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Jesus!
Yeah.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Linda, yeah.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Naw.
Inside, Vince.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
No?
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Here.
Biederman, yes.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Would you?
Sure.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
I want to go home, Merle.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Yeah.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
You got it.
What are you, God?
What else?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
What do you mean?
We what?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
No!!!?
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
I gotta get back, Nick.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Merle gave me this?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Phantom Mary?
That's who.
No.
Up.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
I'll be alright.
Where?
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
He could be brought back.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
Fine.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Not the 'T' word.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Yes.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Yes.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
Take a look at this.
This little thing says I can't.
No -- that's for me to do.
We will --
Lying to you -- Why should I?
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Belle.
But what becomes of our souls?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Well, I'll be --
Leave your tongue off of that!
I'm through with you.
Never!
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Ten throws it is.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Yes -- at midnight.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
You are not so sure that he'll come.
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Coming.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Jabez!
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Oh -- Jabez.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Isn't that your own fault?
I don't know, Jabez.
Mary!
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
It's all right, Sheriff.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
You can talk to me ...
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
It's okay, it's okay.
No, sir.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
John.
How about his job?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Who are you, then?
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Sure.  Follow me.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
Don't I always?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
You don't want to know.
Bullshit.
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Yessir.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
It's okay... it's okay...
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
I love you.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I'm really shakey.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
Yeah... I know.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
Well...
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Well, then...
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
What are you doin' in there?
What do you want to know that for?
I frisk you?
... armed robbery ...
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
I can take care of that.
Give me the keys...
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I don't fool around with you.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
What now, Sonny?
Yeah.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
Dead or alive?
All right ... send them the guard.

What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Wyoming.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Okay.  Which one goes?
I speak what I feel.
Sonny - Here's your document.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I said you were never a faggot.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
What about your toe?
Did it hurt?
<i>What is it?</i>
There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT
No. Please enlighten me.
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Stop it.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Hello?
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
In theory.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Nobody.
I be.  I'm living large.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
Yes?
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
What was you saying?
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years.
Is it a good morning?
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I'm working.
What responsibilities?
Stop tripping.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Fuck!  My money!
Can ya dig it?
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Depends.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Sal, I want my money.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Gotta go.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
I can't be staying long anyway.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
What?
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
That's right.
We're outta here.
On the rebound.
He's nuts.
I love you.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
I know.
I like Mookie a lot.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Yeah, I think.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
In the new library there.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Yeah...
Ooh gross.
Yeah, but I'm buying.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I'm fine.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Okay, what?
What? No! Look.
Well la de da.
I know I am, Mom.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Home school. Til today.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
Will not.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
Our own special bus.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Some what?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
You have beautiful eyes.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
A blimp.
I know I did.
No. Look.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
Do you know what this means?
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
And with that complete loser
That's not your tape.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Oh, go on.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Skateboard.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
You know I do!
Thanks, Pop.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Will that be on the midterm?
Or maybe crossing a river!
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Nothing.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Yes.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
The Emperor's blade.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Always.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Long live the fighters!
Pain.
You feel the flesh crisping?
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
They tried and died....  Jessica!
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
What can be done has been done.
Those sounds could be imitated.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Thank you.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
The <u>women</u>?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
I don't understand.
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
I didn't feel well...
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Eddie, how was I?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I don't know.  Where?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
What do you mean?
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Isn't he?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
You met Basil Rathbone!
I thought he was dead.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Oh, just like in the script!
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Raising money is tough.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
But Greta say --
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
Tits.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Not good...
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Huh?
Who's Dr. Tom?
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
You don't wanna be noticed?
Lines around the block.
I don't know.
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
So how long have you known Eddie?
Mr. Wood!
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
At what point?
Anything good?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Al!
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
What?
Cool.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Right, right...
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
Could've been a nurse?
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Shari, Ray feels --
She left.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Never would be plenty.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Who's in it?
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
The what?
Why?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other...
So?
Everybody's someone.
What do we have to do?
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Screw off.
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Yeah.
I know.
Save it.
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
What...
Do you still have it?
Hi.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Yeah. Why?
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
pierdo.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
Here, get down.
Anything wrong?
So nice
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
I know.
Ethics are...
Right
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
You bet.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Why are you lecturing me?
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Looks like today's your lucky day
I'm looking at new cars.
Sporty.
This weekend.
Door was open.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Sure.
Should we get a what?
Sherry... I love you.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
Yeah.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
I also like bananas.
For what?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
It's Bud.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
This business, Captain?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
How?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
I got to write my report first.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Lynn.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Let's just kill them.
Which one are you and which one am I?
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
What little studio?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
I don't own no shotguns.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
White's a mindless thug.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Okay.  I'll do it.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Just don't shoot me.
I want you to follow Bud White.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
None.  Call it a hunch.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Who are you calling?!
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
You're not.
Turn on CNN.
When can you get it here?
Rachel Banks?
I don't know who he is.
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
They're spooks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
One-twenty.
I called my wife!
You told me no calls.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
Looks like Detroit.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Who?
No he won't.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Not particularly, no.
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<u>What's</u> your point.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
The robbery.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
I can't.
I'm not his attorney.
No, sir.
No.
To buy lingerie.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Something bad happened tonight.
I saw a man die.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
I see her for business.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Just reporters.
What happened to your head?
Well...yeah.
Don't count on it.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
Oh.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
You got a minute?
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We believe he did.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
We'd rather not--
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Good point.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Where's Stacy?
Why?
Are those my Christmas presents?
Really?
Did they take your clothes?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Bobby--
Why would the NSA--
Yeah?
Jerry?
Go fuck yourself.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Yes sir.
We found the originals.
We believe?
Do you have visual?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Excuse me?
As the wife of one of our party.
Pardon?
Yes.  Absolutely.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
No, but I think I do.
Now.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
What?  No!
This is empty, just coming!
You bastard, I was believing you!
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
What's the matter with you?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Right.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Okay.
No.
Don't cut me.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
I don't know what that means.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
She can take you as far as Florence.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
What?
What?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Are you remembering more?
Yes?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
No!

This is what I do.  I do this every day.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
I'll always go back to that church.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What's he saying?
Why?  Are you German?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
I'll call an ambulance.
So what?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Not a word.
Got it.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
That's because I wanted them to!
Let's just see how we do.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
One more item--not on the check list.
It's---beautiful.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.
To our...partnership.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
In eye of that painting.
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Behind you.
Shut up.
The Mask.
A billion dollars.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
My job, my rules.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
No way.
What about you?
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
Remind me why.
We're supposed to.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You damn well thought wrong.
Check out my ball.
I figured that out.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
What's your point?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Yeah.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Don't bother.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
And that's what caused the contamination?
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Really?  It makes me sick.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Uh-huh.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Erin --
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
How do you know that?
Did he say why?
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Nope.  Maiden.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
It happens all the time.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
I do.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Nothing.
Keep your voice down.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Lock the door.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
Have you been logging on?
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Yes?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
You did?
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Come in, Admiral.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
Ben ... Ben ...
What's wrong with him?
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Howls.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
And what are they, pray tell?
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Would you please stop calling me that?
That's quite a compliment.
No lightspeed?
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
I'm sorry too.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
But I feel The Force flowing!
Free your mind and return he will.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
If it must be.  Yes.
I'll die first.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
They're...pretending to dress.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Where?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Having second thoughts?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
No.
I'm here.
So where's Plissken?
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Right over there.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
We'll see.
Looking to get out.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Are you crazy?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Sewers. Come on.
Find Cuervo Jones.
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
...I saw nothing.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
So be it, to the death.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Of Merlin?
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
But not from your destiny.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
Well hurry then, and get it.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
We are to blame.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I didn't know that.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
I see, your excellency.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
What's this?
No, she was heavily sedated.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
What!
Fine thank you.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Please go away.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
No.
He didn't mention her.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Please.
Are you sure?
Father?
You like it?
Yeah.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
I wouldn't talk.
How do you know?
Okay.
Honey it's to help you.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
I stole it.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
I've seen it.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm not Regan.
In time.
Holy water.
Okay
No momma.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Her heart.
I've seen him.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Is that a threat?
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
I've seen it.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
O'Lord hear my prey.
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Do you have an appointment?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're not going to drive.
You're not going to drive!
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Teeth.
They're falling out.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Go fuck yourself.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
How we doing?
Fuck him.
Try the black Knable.
Why the interest?
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's not family.  It's business.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
Yeah, okay.
What?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Let's get it over with.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
How about these?
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Yeah, fine.
A few bars!
Right.
Okay.
Good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.  You mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Doesn't it matter to you?
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Two hours ago!
What the hell are these?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Huh?
How come I didn't hear anything?
He was just having fun.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
The tenth's out.
Twenty-eight years.
No.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Shut up, Frank.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I'll take the Mallory.
Yeah.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Yes, it is.
This is where the auditions were.
We ran long.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
When we know.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Hey!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Big feet.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
I said I was sorry.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Hey.
First times. Hey, look at this.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Forget it.
Huh?
What?
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
He doesn't bite.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Yeah.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
Frank works hard.
Pretty much.
Not for money. With my mother.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
The Stratford.
Huh?
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Every year.
I guess in case one year they're not.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Oh.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Coffee?
You don't pick your brother.
So how's the cat food business?
Another five years, huh?
Sounds big.  What's he do?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Wow.
Merry Christmas.
Fine.  You?
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
... Thanks.
My place.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
A few blanks?  Like what?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Something good?
So you had a nightmare.
One last time.  It's important ...
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Would it?
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You said it, Jon, not me.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Janie?
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
No problem.
Normally, I would.  But today ...
-- I've got to study.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Back then -- who wasn't?
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
So you left her?  Just like that?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
I don't know.  Maybe...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
But I think I like you better this way...
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
I think I could figure it out.
Thats where you work.
Kates my wife...
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Everyone needs something.
What the hell is happening to me?!
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
No, I didnt...thats great.
Uh huh...
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
You hear me complaining about that?
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
No, shes not.
...my feet are hurtin...
Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
If you want to look at it that way...
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Its good, right?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
And now...?
But you always seem so certain.
Its wonderful...
Im out of the doghouse?
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Its like a museum.
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Its good to see you...
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
Thats the one...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
Where is he?
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Okay, Ill take them...
Of course I did.
I'd like that, too.
Merry Christmas...
I like the sound of that.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Victor's better at these things.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Victor did.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
That's terrible news...
Ben, are you there?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
But all these people...
I think that thing is Ben.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Not at all.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
It's been changed.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
What?  What do you mean you --
We need to get past them.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
What in the world would give me that idea?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Of course.  Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
You <u>were</u>?
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
Susan.  What are you doing?
Here's the overall Target Area...
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
I'd hold that off awhile.
Brain injury.
<Me>?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
No question of her loyalty.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Yes?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
We must!
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
That's what they pay me for.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
You left something out.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
On the Repeater.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Then don't drift down further.
What do you mean?
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
Unghh... oh, geez...
I don't think so. It's nice.
Whoa, Daddy.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
...The heck d'ya mean?
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
GOT IT?
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
End a April.
Oh, yah, I know that!
You have children?
Oh, now he's adorable.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Uh-huh.
Mm.
Uh-huh.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
And what about the other fella?
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
No, no, fax is -
Know who this is?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
What's goin' on there?
We might be innarested.
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Oh, pretty good.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
So?
Yah, is this Marge?
What'd he say?
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
- looking.
We've got a -
They're real good.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
That's terrific.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Well... Why don't we...
Right, right.
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Yeah, both of us.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Have you finished those reports?
What does that mean?
This is... really a shock...
I'd like to thank the academy...
Sure.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
I don't know -- am I?
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
So you're staying in tonight?
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
I could check your prostate.
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
We did make love?
Answer the question!
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Who's this?
Who do you think I am?
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
No, supply oxygen?
What do you want me to do?
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
This is crazy.
What fight?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Good answer.
Don't mention me.
Look at your hand.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
It isn't... ?
Fucking sweet.
No.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
And, sometimes you control it...
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
What... what are you saying?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
Um, well... technically, no.
I'm going to...
If you know, I know.
Yes.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why what?
You need me.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
Yes, it is.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
You were there?
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
Random, sure.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Carter.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Maybe.  What's this about?
No.  What's this about?
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Clean up?  I don't...
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Yeah?
He's not a witch.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Let us out!
I don't.
Design?
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
That's what I'm doin'!
No.
Star Wars?
No.
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
One hundred.
Read you.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
Exactly.
Fermented fish sauce.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
I need a vacation.
Alright.  Home run.
Nothing we can do, man.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Huntington Beach, California.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Let's get that tent down!
Sorry, Sir.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
American.  Come to get you out.
I could take it or leave it.
Yeah.  Big time.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Well did you or didn't you?
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
I was attacked.
You still believe in God?
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
I was nine in the sixties.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Yes.  They're free.
What girl?  I didn't notice.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
They're --  -- What?
I'm the one what?
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
You really want to help me?
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Sure...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No just Parry.
I don't like horror movies!
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
It sounds exciting.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
You don't have to say that.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
You're the pathetic one, not me.
Do you love me, Bobby?
What the hell is that?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Okay...
What?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Palm Apodaca.
Washington.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
I didn't get it, did I?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Well, you seem very professional...
Now don't...
Who's Van Oost?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Tomorrow, then.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
That's what you said?
Yeah, I think I could.
Of course I'd like to.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
It's all right. I'm fine.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Why you have an attitude for?
So get the fuck outta here.
Wussup.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
Nothin'.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
She fucks it all up!
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Which one?
For real?
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
Yeah.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Your friend must be misinformed.
I'm a good friend of hers.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Not really.
Wha'?
Unbelievable.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
Sonofabitch.
I have no idea.
They didn't do anything.
Not luck. They don't want me.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
My God, you're serious.
Not a prayer.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
We play tennis at the club.
I don't know. I don't have any.
Your aunt?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
There is?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Okay. Some idea.
Affirmative.
Gum thought Brazil.
Thank you.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Whoops.
Velma.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Where are you going?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
What are you doing here?
No problem.
Fletch?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Come inside.
Sure, all drifters do.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Sure.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Don't say shoot, okay.
Not me.
No problem, boss.
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Preoccupied with what?
I love the outfits.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Yes.
God...
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
What does all this mean?
Bastard.
Don't tell me I can't --
In her cabana, sir.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
What?
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
Who are you?
I'm her cousin.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
I don't know.  Look!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
Excuse me?
So you...
I'll do my best.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Great pipes.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Exactly.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Make eye contact when you say that.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
How much?
You gave it to the girls for one.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
What?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
Ye-ah.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Twelve pack?
You need it.
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Ciao.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Julian, you're fired.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's funny, you're cute.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
It's yours too!
Encore du sho ping!
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Il fallait le faire.
What happens to the schedule?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
S'right.
What?
Fake it.
What's he do?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Morning.  Sometime.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Policy man in Queens.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Just for mistakes of parking?
Darling, may I have this one?
Why is it called Hellgate?
For garbage?
I been damn careful up to now.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
You remember Mary Finelli?
Nothing.
Well, why not a little of the King?
The usual.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
He ain't the only one.
Wish you weren't.
Luck, my ass.
I think you know, Frank.
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Hello?
W...B...2...YXB.
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
Sun spot?
I lost you.
I never knew you, Dad.
It did, Pop.  It did.
October 12, 1969.
I don't understand.
Chief?!  Is that you?
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Tell me.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
H-hi.
It's not your fault, Dad.
No.
In my pocket.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Better.
Longbranch...?
Whoa, I just...I just...
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
You work too hard, John.
Yeah, that's right.
No.  What house you work?
A hot shot, huh?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Where are you going?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Barely.
Yes, man!
Chuck... look.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Keep looking.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
Stop the car!  Now!!
I have to.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Why?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
I wish it was.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
What's it to ya?
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Are they grown-ups?
Who ya calling?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
Skin stretcher was human.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
N...nothing.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Yeah...
Okay.
-- Bad?!
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Really?
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Yeah.
No.
This is Jason's fault!
Don't be ridiculous!
Nothing.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Yeah...a lot.
We changed our minds.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
I'm not!!
Very bad today.
Alla puttanesca.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Where is it?
It's your best play, Nicky.
Paisley Porter.
What are you talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
This is how we've managed to last.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
That's completely crazy.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I'm not sure.
Everything.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Two-all after six.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Who the hell cares?
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
Life is good.
What did it say?
You're hurting my head.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
They're only gonna lose.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
What am I doing?
That's my cousin, Angelo.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
I want to believe.
Washed away.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
I think I remember.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I hear good things about the new play.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I'm going home to my machine.
As I told you about English policemen.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Eleven.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
Did they take your clothes?
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
I thought you were against fighting.
Panditji -- please, help me.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
Hm.  Is it?
A great deal.
I --
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
No.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
Grudges?
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Luca could still be an accomplice.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Six one.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
Any particular reason?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
I'm travelling too.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
How do I square the accident?
You worried about the cost?
I've found him too.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Yes.
Why would we do that?
You celebrate, Jerome?
You'll be next.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Only every time I'm in here.
I'm not doing it.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
No way. I've got to get out now.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
It's all right.
Sure.
Better than I remembered.
Suit yourself.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
Bullshit.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
You sent me to him.
I mean it.
El Paso.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Let's do it.
Twenty eight hundred.
Yeah.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Oh, Jesus... how?
What's wrong?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Where do we go from here?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
We walk.
No, I'm afraid not.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Can't leave the desk.
Not now.
What's it to you?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
That right?
How long have you been married?
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Who?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Nothing. What could I do?
Yeah.
What?
Yes.
What name?
Why?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Doreen.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
It's the truth.
Really?
So where are we going, Princess?
Brumby.
Your brother? What you talking about?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Working at Woolworths.
No.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Where you off to?
How'd you find me?
No, you won't.
They came back?
Don't ask me.
That little shit!
Pension him off.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Yeah.
The gun he means.
Knock it off, Gerald.
Where am I going to work?
I'm not?
I had to.
It's too...
Eh?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Nurses.
With River Oaks?
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
That's right...
Someone should hurt them.
No, we're just...
No.  Not actually.
What did he say?
No.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
It's a waste of time.
That's...
Down the street.
...what am I going to do all month...
Was I?
No.
You think so?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch?
...did they...
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Could I...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Get in the goddamn room.
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Let me...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
Yes.
The leads are assigned randomly...
And what if you don't close.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Somebody broke in.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
What are you talking about?
You're so full of shit.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I don't know what you are saying.
Who kept the other half?
Was it?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Because I don't like you.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
What does that mean?
Last night, this morning.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do...
Uh...
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
Me.
What do I...?
Mmmm...
Tuesday.
And the check is...
You did that?
Why not?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
Some of them...
You did?
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
John...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
He's going to kill Fanucci.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
How are the kids?
You're not my father!
Tom is right.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Let's go.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
...Who?
But, you told me yourself...
What do you want me to do?
We have time.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
What?
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Yes.
I don't know.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
Mike, at three and a half...
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Did my brother go back?
Do you gamble?
Do you owe markers?
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Very well.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Yes, Michael.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
I deny his every charge.
When do we talk?
You were unfair with them.
They feel cheated.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
No, she's here.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
How much more a month?
What was that?
I won't keep you another minute...
What's to be jealous of?
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Expect nothing fancy.
Of course.  I am married still.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
I stink to high heaven right now.
What?  Oh yes.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
But why?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
What?
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Go ahead.
Did anyone laugh?
No.  I could have, though.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Not at the moment.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
You first.
Something happened to him?
Do I look okay?
I don't hear anything.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
David produced her last picture.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Do I have any other choice?
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
What happened?
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What'd you say?
What was that?
Oh Clayton.
I think I'll hang around.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Thank you.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Then who did?
Yes.  Perfectly.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
More your line.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Elsa?
Of course.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Luminal.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Quite.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Of course.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Sit?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Tell me about Kip -
What kind of job... ?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
How ya doing?
I don't want him hurt...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
What do you mean -- ?
Let them go --
Get out of here, then. Now.
The other day....
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
C'mon, man ...
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Peugot convertible ...
Gray.
Dignity...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
We don't -- ?
No.
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
You, too
Yeah ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Something like that -
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Me...
"Shadow games?"
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
The era when crime didn't pay --
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
A distinction worth noting ...
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
That what you want?
I take out my slim-jim...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
Of course. Hi, Junie --
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
I'll see you soon --
Who's "Eleanor?"
You sure I can't go with ya?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Checkin' it out
Billy, how are you?
No more shines, Billy.
Why would I get into that?
Nods.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
Nah.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Will you stop.
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy  ...
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
All right, then.
--or a tail--
What are we gonna do up there?
No, and we got four of 'em.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
No one. I didn't have the number.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Yeah, it is.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
I have about seventy-three...
Good, it was all right.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Of course.
An integer.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
Hey, how you doin'?
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
I did.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
I live right around the corner.
I think so.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Who?
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
Come in.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I don't got a crush on her.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Have you read all these books, Will?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
No.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Haven't called her.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don't.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Yeah.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
It sure ain't good.
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, sounds good.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
So you just want to use me and go?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
You know, nothing special.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Your house must have been a zoo.
Do you know all their names?
How the hell did you do that?
Exactly.
Some, a little.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
How do you know that?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
What am I scared of?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
No, you don't want to hear that.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Joe!
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'?
I'll get Rosasharn.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Now I can't breathe.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Okay. Go on.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Joad.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Got a warrant?
Say, who runs this place?
Crate fell on me.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
I never heard nothin' about it.
Casy! What you doin' here?
I aim to.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
Women is always tar'd.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Hush!
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
No plants.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
I'd a found you, Ma.
Sometimes they do.
I'm ready.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Ya say we're acrost?
You promised, Tommy.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
They killed Casy first.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Whatsa matter?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
I never--
In the corporate offices.
Don't say that.
What?
What?
Really?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Here is now there. There is here.
Bad experiences.
What's that?
That'd be good.
Like love?
Yes.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
You never could have kept this from me.
Mmm.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Out Loud?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Excellent. Here they come.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
That sounds pretty interesting...
I guess.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
I don't think so.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
He didn't.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I've looked at it.
Tell them my house exploded.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
You too.
He sold me this bad boy.
He gave me a great deal.
Work's good for the soul.
To shoot you. Correct.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What's that to miss?
When I was first married.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
You too.
Need a lift?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
What?!
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
What about him?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
I don't care.
What?
No, you just act like you do.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You already did.
You're right. Good.
About what?
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
What?... Oh baby...
Sure... What's Grace up to?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Okay.
No.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
She will if you think she should.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Okay.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
May I have a suggestion?
Oh, I don't know...
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
That's what some folks say.
You know her?
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
She's an editor.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
What does that mean?
I want to see Pilgrim.
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
I understand...
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Sometimes.
Now that's cool.
Hack the Planet!
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Shh!
That's far out!
...as they snoop onto us.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Burn!
Joey's getting stupid busy.
We did it!
Do my ears deceive me?
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Yeah.
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Gill.
What's happening?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
What, it left a note?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
555-4202.
Real charmer.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
No, you don't understand.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Get back!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
No way. No how.
Got it Earl.
Like a real sister?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
You bet.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Yeah, hurry up.
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Then we'll be safe?
Dad, what's going on?
All right.
Hi.
Hi Jamie.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Least I'm not alone.
Evil.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Don't touch him Jamie!
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Okay. Bye.
I wasn't spooked.
Thanks.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Promise?
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
I don't think so...
Have a good time.
See you.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
What did he look like?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
What is it, Laurie?
Was it the bogyman?
Yes.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
What does that mean?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Mm-mm!
Mmm?
Uh --
And then, uh, April...huh?
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
Mmm.
It depends on what way you want to go.
No, he called late last night.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I cry at the opera.
It's terrific!
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Yeah?
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
No?
Bye.
Yeah.
Did you ever read this one--?
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
What are you doing?!
I have been in love with you for so long.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Oh, my God.
Oh, all the time.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Get his wine away.
Yeah.
I am glad to see you.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, honey!
No, thank you.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Yeah?
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Huh?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
He's fine.
...you know?  I, uh...
That's a beauty!
Oh!
Is there no chance?
Well, then a third opinion.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
True.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Two thousand dollars.
I should get a garter belt.
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh!
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Yeah, that's clerical.
How?
Hmm!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Yeah, it was.
I'm okay.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Oh, yeah?  What?
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I--
Hi.
Mmm, what?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
I <u>swear</u> to you...
I hereby acknowledge that...
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
I know her by the Back.
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...would you excuse me...?
Yeah, so where is he?
Impossible.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>?
...are you alright, sir...?
Somewhere in Italy.
Have the child taken to bed.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.
Mmm...
....what...?
Let the girl go.
Starling...?

Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Why did you look at me that way?
How so?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Enchante.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Sir, with all due respect....
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
And how did he do that?
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
...what has she done to harm you...?
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
Every suicide kills two.
Why?
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.
...but:  this particular statue...
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...yes, yes, yes....
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...no...
...no.
...would you use a small word?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?"
Yes.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
You guys have been so colossal...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
That wants to be a Yes.
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
I just never thought of you in that...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
It's been known to happen.

I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Shoot.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
Uh-huh.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Heather? Wha...
What are you doing here?!
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Heather.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
No.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give it up girl!
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Sure.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I didn't. Cherry.
I don't really like your friends either.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Chick-en.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
You must have had fun.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Punch it in!
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
May<u>be</u>.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Get a job.
That's three things.
But my name's not...
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
What's that?
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Come on through.
frowns at Henry.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
It's so beautiful!
What??
That idiot boarder?
Your wife...?
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
All finished.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Just get better okay?
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Yeah, how's that?
What's the occasion?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Someone special.
Ambrose. I know.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What's the difference?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
No please make yourself at home.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
I don't work here.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Who the hell are you talking to?
Wow you are out of it.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Try stupid.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
What's "cynical"?
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
What about?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Right.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
-- a sense of proportion.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Yeah, that was easy.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
It's a living.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
I think we should talk first.
I'm thirsty.
Uh huh.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Here, take this out to the table.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
No.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Shut up.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Yes.
What is it?
I'd like you to see this.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
It's circumstantial.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Who are you?
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
That's all?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
For what?
I'm sure they will.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She's a treasure she is.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
How?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
I'll be fine.
Jennifer.
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Yes -- it is.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
Not unless they're immortal.
Get out.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
What?  How?
What's that next to him?
Why?
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Get to work.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
What do you want to do?
I understand.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
I don't know.
You fucked up, Glen.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You said they would be here!
You'd better be kidding.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
You have her cell number?
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Go, Mickey.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Not until the man calls.
In my room.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Can you get into the office?
No!  They're right here --
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Cockroaches?
Of course.
I'll be back.
Let me see your identity card.
Their people?
I can't, I don't have the men.
What did they say?
The police are very busy.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
You think they will believe you?
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Give me the phone.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Why sir?
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Call, sir?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
Move? Where to?
The third floor are low class rooms.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Jean Baptiste!
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Where are you hurt, son?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
In Ruhengeri?
Yes.
What?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What's wrong?
There is one thing I need right away.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
The lieutenant wants the register.
The staff, the guests.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Can I help you?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
I'm confused.
So what stopped her?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Oh dear.
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Three times, to be exact.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
And we get this money when?
Best of a nightmare.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
-- that's the fact, bud --
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
I don't do groups.
Jesus!
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
And then what happens?
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
I never saw you --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
What's going on?
Why not?
He must've unsealed the room!
Melissa...?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
Good-bye.
That poor little girl.
I don't understand.
No it won't - no it won't!
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Ok...
Where is she?
My God, I heard something!
Daddy help!
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
The place is pretty dusty.
You didn't think much about that before.
What?
I don't know.  That's strange.
Were you fooling with the power?
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I think everything's ready.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
No...  NO!
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Thank you.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
Jesus Christ ...
I know what I saw.
And what did you discover?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
I don't know ...
So where is it?
What happened to him?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
What is it?
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Would you know this store again?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Can we see?
I'm sorry.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
I laughed, I cried.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
You re not thinking of going to...
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
How long were you in?
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh.  Well, what's this?
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
I don't care.
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
You want an address on that last one?
What job?
Yes.
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
You certainly do.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Employer?  The president?
Tell me about it...
Sharp.
The Hudsucker Hoop!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
I'm happy enough.
Adenoids?
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Why yes, do you know it?
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Now, Aim --
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Terrific.
Tell me about it.
Forty-eight years...
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Well, I --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
But, buddy --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Wait a minute!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Get out of my sight.
Well... I'm for it...
Yeah, tell me about it.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She looks in her purse...
He notices.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Alive?
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
I've never heard of a cure.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Yes -- on the boat.
Is she a doctor?
I like her already.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
You didn't drive her mad.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
She was beautiful.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
I wasn't star--
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Good night.
So early?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
Stuffed and baking.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
That one.
What do you mean?
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
We're not going anywhere.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
All right.
Yeah.
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
What?
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Jesus all right enough!
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Let me.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Nobody.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
It's not a bother.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Educated guess.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
Forget how to ride a bike.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
But not too ashamed.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Moisture! Moisture!
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Let's see!
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
No!
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Then why'd you come after me?
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah.
Watching what?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
Actually...
Don't worry about him...
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
We already did.
But there wasn't any...
Yeah.  All over.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
I know.
Why?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No.
I told her to come.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
You know what about.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
Habit.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
You don't know.
Best friend?
You don't know.
What was it?
Yes down at the station.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
No back-up.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Yes, and very beautiful.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
She is.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Yes... My God...
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I didn't realise.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
It will grow back again!
Stop her Louis!
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
What have you done?
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
He'll never let us go.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
You are more beautiful than any of them.
And no one knows but us...
Never.
You really believe that?
But if she dies...
Why should I be?
I want it!
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
But why do you want me?
Yes...
I want a woman.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
No...
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
CLAUDIA!!!
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
I tried...
You're not lying to me, are you?
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
No...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Yes!
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
What the hell would you call this?
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
No, I'm the King of the World.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Who?
I told you.
I'm okay.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It's...him.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
He's in it with Willis?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Not anymore.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
What is up with that weirdo?
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
Drunk again?
In case you do so, would you --
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Poor Cathy --
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
She has never mentioned her family.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
They shall not hurt you
My last name is Pherides.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
I can't understand that.
But the war, the army  they need you.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
The General threatened me.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
All right  all right.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
I hate to do this, fella.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
It isn't me!
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Made what?
No, of course not.
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
George Bailey.
What's that book you've got there?
Hiya, George!
All right.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Give the flower a drink.
Hee-haw!
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Hmmm?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Oh, George!
Yes  charge.
Oh, George.
No. No.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Nothing.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Hello?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
This way.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
All right, sir.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
I don't like coconuts.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Uh-huh.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
I'm going to scream!
Tuesday.
Well, then, sit down.
To keep from being an old maid.
Left them at the office.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Going up to see Zuzu.
What plates?
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Sure, sure I am.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Swim for it!
Good.  It's terrible.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Listen to Andy, Sean.
The Shark.
Sean!  Catch it!
Gangway, Turkies!
You bet.  Hang on....
Anyone got another set of sails?
The rope!  The rope!
It's still there!
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Not the drugstore!
Right.
Please.  It's my job.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Yeah?
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
That's it.
Can't you tell?
Late.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
What'd I say?
Going out.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
What?
That's it?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
What's daddy doing?
Now I really want to see it.
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Great.
Waiting for Andy.
Great.
Help!  Help!
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
3:30.
What's that mean?
Mike?  Our Mike?
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
Is there something I don't know about?
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
I love it.
Sean, baby, please....
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
You always go with Andy.
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
I can get it.
What is it, 97 days?
Hope I make it through both.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Honey, I gotta go.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Up.
Make up your mind.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
What's that?
No,  I'm not going through there.
... He ought to put him in here.
Well, that's why you got it.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Who's going to do it?
But you --
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
No!
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Why are you?
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Brian, he's coming around!
How'd it get in here?!
They still seem nervous.
Not good enough.
How you doing, Kelly?
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Yeah, from Boston.
Massachussettans aren't.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
And alone.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
I don't know, what else is there?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
He's diving!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
What?
Hey.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Buzz off.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
All right, hit those lights too.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Sharks???
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
That bugger moves fast.
We forgot to stop at the store.
We need beer....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
No....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
I like it.  Really....
Whatever happens next.....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
Adds flavor....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
Good night, Daddy....
What?
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
I'm not going to quit now....
You just got here....
I'm fine....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
Doesn't matter....
No one does till they learn....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A big one....
No!
Won't you get in trouble...?
My vision is perfect....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
Yes you can....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Just like that?
What's that....?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Inch by inch....
Feathers all over the place....
Stop busting my hump....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Gave them the day off....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Hoagie.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
'Snuck up on me....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You don't like my voice...?
Screw you, Jake....
I've got to get to her....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
In a few minutes....
I told you....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Only me and Mom ..
I hope I'm not intruding?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
I think you're here all day.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
O.K.
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
So am I. But where's my money?
Pay me, and I shut up.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
You want me to stop the car?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
Listen to me saying what?
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
Car accident.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Are you sure you didn't call?
Bits.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I don't see that at all ..
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Have you known her long?
How d'you know what I'm like?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I'm going back to the institute.
Why does he want to kill me?
I'm blind because my father drank.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
The man from the F.B.I.
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Ask him.
I know about the bachelor party.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
My son... my mind...
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Hello?
I just got goosebumps.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Do you have something to drink?
Good idea.  Thank you.
Mission... statement...
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
You don't have to explain.
Right.  I'll come in.
Easy, easy --
So this break... is a break-up.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Call me tomorrow.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Another drink please.
Uh, not today, but --
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Forget it.  Forget it.
How do I know?
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
What DO you stand for???
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You okay?
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Dick.
-- and I'll get 'em.
I'm not your brother!
Funny.
I'm scared.  What is it?
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Nothing.
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
No, it's...
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Where is it?
Just hold on.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Baryonyx?
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
NO!
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Raptors, mostly.
A well-accepted theory.
Yeah.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Then we go home?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
I want to be an astronaut.
But then you never get to go in space.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
No.  I feel something.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Where does it say that?
Come on!
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Okay.
You've broken its leg!
The velociraptors.
Good.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Piss.
Oh, God.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
No way.
No.
Where's Kelly?
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Birdshit?
You think this is all a joke?
I believe in him.
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
I'm trying!
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
Damn!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
What now?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
How would we cut off the lysine?
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade...
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They smell.
Dilophosaurus.
I know.
- - barfs them up - -
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The other car!
What's that?
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
And scary.
Anti-nature.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Yeah.
- - shut up.
He sends his apologies.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Yeah.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Listen, ahh - -
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
Really?
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
That's a good idea.
"Thunder lizard!"
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
There's gotta be something - -
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Who?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
I'll stay awake.
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
What?
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
You have a map.
Who is this? What's going on?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
That's open to debate.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
What was the matter with it?
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
Did you?
-- In what sense?
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Success or nothing?
A man must eat --  And drink.
In a manner of speaking.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You're just doing your job.
Sit down, Kafka.
... My ... social situation?
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I do.
Yes.
No.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
You don't believe that.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Eight -- and seven months.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
It usually is.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
It's ... lovely.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
I photographed it extensively, father.
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Compassion.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Please --
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
No.
No, that's not --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
Mm.
How would I remember?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
What do you think?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Is that what you gave him?
I don't see anything, do you?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
-- Then you don't need me.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I don't get you.
Don't touch anything.
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
I am.
They don't scare me any more.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
It's got to make sense some way.
Well as a matter of --
Yeah.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Just send me a money order.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
I think she's trying that.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Yeah.
What else do you know?
I see you have people there. What are their names?
On earth.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
You got a letter from mom.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Mom, I mean dad?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I'm allergic to onions.
You're no bargain either, pal.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Dad?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
No.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Like a principal?
I don't understand, daddy.
Who will read me my stories?
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Then I have concluded my questions.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Eight, almost nine years.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
I...I don't know...
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
I don't know...
Fine.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I don't know, Jim...
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Kramer...
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
I'm going to take it.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Six.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
It's going to cost.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
No.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
I told her you're doing a
What?
You and Charley?
It is alright, Father.
But, I am in charge.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
All?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Time to study.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Answer.
No. This war is almost over.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
Good day.
Thank you.
You will always!
Does he have the spot?
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Is that true or pretend?
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
I will miss you.
How could I ever leave?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
No.  Do you?
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
It happens when I land.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
What the hell are you doing?!!
They don't really attack underwater and--
Yup.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
You do?
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
That hurt my feelings.
I never had sex with you!
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I'd be able to see something.
I'm sorry but you're...
Good.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Look.
Okay.
Well...
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Keep firing!
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Good thinking.
White perch.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
I'll take it!
Well.  At wakes.
Seconds.  Three, four.
You talk to the married couple?
What kind of backup do we have?
It's just that--
I'm sorry.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Yes.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
I guess.
Kevin, hey.
Absolutely.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
A tooth?
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
Wild guess.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
Kelly--
Shitbutt?
Thanks, Ardelia.
Why not?
Hot damn, Clarice.
I will... I promise.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
I think we may be, yes.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Yes sir.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Sewing...
Did you ever work with her?
Yes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
All flayed...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Killed outright?
How long did you live there?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Yes...
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Can we rest soon?
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Sorry to disappoint you...
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
I have nothing to go back for.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
When? How?
"Some"?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
What else?
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Fire!!!
Sir!
Fire!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
And this?
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Granted.
La victoire.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What?...
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
What dead one on the ship?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
How much time does that give us?
Where's Jones?
Where's Doc?!
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Do it.
I signed-up for the stock option.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
What are you going to do to him?
It's had a meal.
No fuckin' lie...
Sixpack...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Hardly.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Well, it's still a good idea.
Seven hundred for the pair.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Well what?
It's a Samoan pub.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
About twenty minutes.
Just carrying a bag.
Sure is.
Furry muff, let's go.
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
OK, open the gate.
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
A hundred grand.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
At what, exactly?
So?
That's going on optimism.
Nick the Greek.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Twelve.
How the fuck should I know?
What do you mean?
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
I can't take any more school.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
I-I can do the job, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
I'm feeling okay--
Yes, Sergeant.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
That badge--
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
That's in Maverick County.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
If it's too late--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
They fought against the Indians?
He's still pissed off about it.
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
You own this place?
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
We should just do it.
Have we had trouble there before?
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Protection?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
We have a daughter.
He was a unique individual.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
We don't need a new jail.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
--Santiago.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
You go by your old house?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Do you?
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
And the ten thousand?
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Steve?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
I was too busy.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
That was the night he disappeared?
He ever accept cash for a favor?
What do you think?
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
We haven't talked since high school.
So she tells me three times a week.
Yeah.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Nothing.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Couple months before I was born--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
I been working on a few things.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
I know that.
Thirty-five bucks.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
How?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
Why would I do that?
Deep shit?
He's a priest?
About?
You'll do more.than that.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
Did your husband know Quaid?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
That's my business. Harry.
Yes.  You do that.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
It was more than that, I think.
I wasn't.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
No word from D'Amour?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
I heard he was the best.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Mine.
Maybe I just bought it.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
I don't think the dead much care.
Swann's wife.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yeah, I know.
I won't say anything.
What's her problem?
For what?
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
And he's dead?
Fuck you.
No!
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Two years.
Philosophy.
I'm here for the week.
Hi, Charlie.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
OK, see you downstairs.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
How old is she?
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah, look at that thing.
Working.
No.
A coke.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Yes?
Oh?
I don't think so.
Yes?
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
That's ok.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Do you want I send it to your room?
Why do you have to defend her?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
I got some hair stuff.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Sure.
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
It's probably trivial.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
What happened?
Must be a spare set.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
And how would you describe him?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
It's nothing.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
He will.  He has great faith.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
What's his name?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
I had to.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
We're going to do this.
You are the younger of two...
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
It's Detective Smythe.
We millionaires yet?
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Where is she now?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
That's ridiculous.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Are you okay?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You're a caterer?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Oh, sorry.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
To do what you love.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Dad.  What are you doing here?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
I just can.
For how long?
So that means I have to ride with you.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Who's Spalding?
God, here we go.
With a jacked-up attitude.
I don't.
You either.
Hey.
None of your business.
I wanted you to.
It happens, right...
So you fucked around to prove a point!
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Yup.
No.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Something was just missing.
We need to talk.
Better late than never, right?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
At one in the morning?
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
What's that, not great?
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Okay.
I've been hearing you.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
What mess?
What?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Oh that's good.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
GET OUT.
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
If you're not here for a 422 --
Really?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
You don't know how crazy I am.
please, what is it, please --
Claudia.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Ready to go,go,go?
It's upstairs.
-- Richard.
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Son, don't --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
Sorry, little man.
No.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
I ain't fuckin with you --
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Stay that way.
Gently, son --
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Do you wanna sit down?
She loves you.
Who?
Twelve.
Hi.  Is Frank there?
You got us a room so quick?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
Go ahead and waste your time.
I'm quietly judging you.
She's my mother.
people die.
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
Yeah.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Are you lyin' to me?
Ok. What's your name?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Yes.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I need you to get me Paula --
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Love you too..
How long with Ellen?
How long with Paula?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
You're her boyfriend?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Like what?
What's MOW?
No they don't --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
mmmhmm.
...I don't....
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
I'm fine. nothing.
I didn't know the answer --
Go to bed.
Hi.
It's not right.
I have money.
M'lady...?
I wish to discuss your brother.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
So what has changed?
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
I know.  God go with you.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
No, not Louis!
Well... Well... Okay.
What use am I?
Who?
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
Perhaps this will help.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Raoul --
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I know.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
She will be at the ball.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
D'Artagnan...
Phillippe.  Rest now.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
Get out of my way.
I am unhurt --
Thank you, Keeper.
What was the end page?
Yes, yes, go on.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Raoul... is in love...
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
So what?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Don't worry -
Fine...
Right behind you.
Fine -
What?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
I'll live...
Seattle.
Figure you would have tried it already.
You'll find out - soon enough.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I knew I could count on you.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
That was Peterson upstairs.
That's when it happened?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Twenty minutes max.
When do they go to press?
Not the Bible?
No.
You said the guy down here is good.
I know...
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Have him peel the top label back.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
It'll do fine.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
It's me.
The Tooth...
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No.
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
God, no.
Uh... sure...
That's true.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What about the dog?
What did he want?
We have it good, don't we?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
I have to see somebody.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
My name's Will Graham. I...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
We don't know that.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
I thought you would have some ideas.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
No.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Those are my terms.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But wasn't it funny?
What, you don't think I can beat him?
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hi... am I late?
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
Then your father's a wimp.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
It is apparently not working.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Are you sure?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
It's my name.
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
Know what?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
What?
Oh, God.
Two grand.
Right...
Hear what?
He's going to pop!
What are you doing?
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
I got you.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
He's beginning to believe.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
How do you know all this?
What do you know?
You could say that.
No.
What truth?
More important than what is when?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
For what?
You -- you're too fast.
The body cannot live without the mind.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Morpheus, I don't know --
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
What?
What do you mean, without him?
Who are you?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
From you.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
I have to.
I'm coming with you.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What do they want?
Neo, this has to be done!
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Duck!
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
He's alive.
You're not far from Cypher.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
'Thou art then a king?'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Kennedy.
Not quite...but keep trying.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
How?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
I understand.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Don't be smart.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Mind your own business.
No.
Good idea.
What pipes?
That bad, huh?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Whatever.
I know.
No you weren't.
Yes, you did.
What did he do?
Teresa.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
But...
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Count it.
Yeah, so things'll be even.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
No.
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Annie made them.
It's for the party, Dad --
That you've been to Susan?
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Hi.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Am I not obligated to?
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
A voice?
No no, not you.
Sounds good.
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Me, too.
Uh -- he's from out of town --
'Just kidding'?
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Please, Drew.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
No.  Nothing.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Yes?
Are you?
As long as it takes.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
I didn't know that.
Love.
What do you mean 'free'?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Do you love Drew?
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Then why are you here, Joe?
Not now.
Gay?
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I don't know who you are.
And is your heart beating strangely?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Don't.  That will come later.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
Yes.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
You tell me, Bill.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
I told you, 'watch it'.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Does she know where she's going?
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Get him in here.
Thank you.
I don't!
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
Watch it!
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Next week?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
How did you know?
I am.  With you.
So what's wrong with that?
That's all?
Nothing.
Yer damn right.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
You and 'Honey'?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
Seen you together, that's all.
Why?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't say anything else.
Quiet!
I don't want blood on them.
You told me.
So you have information for me?
Deals?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Kill him.
Just relax.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Yeah?
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
No!
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Can I ask you something?
How do you know about me?
Who's your boyfriend?
John Gammell?
Probably left it in your room.
Shut it, Teddy.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy didn't have a wife.
Yes, I will.
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Why would I have a gun?
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
"And" what?
Yes you do...
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
And what is that?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Why?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
What'd Neptune tell you?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
Nothing.
Who knows...
On my way back...
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
No.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
How will it stand up?
Sonny...?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
You set this up!
Meaning...?
Do we need this...?
You're hoping to get a look at what?
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Sure you're all right?
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Don't need a comb.
Twenty bucks...
And what?
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
No. You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
We go through the wall?
You want to split your hernia again?
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
The Hilton.
I know.
Sixty?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Beats working.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
...She was on the plane.
Lucky girl.
About as good as it looks.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
Twelve years.
Hello.
Thank you.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
Section 13?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
Then I'll cut his balls off.
What is it? . . . Billy?
Who got the Frenchman out?
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Right.
No, you talkin' at me.
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Oh, man, there you go again.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
Manny...
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
We?
No, there's...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
I was just late.
Susan, we're not b-
No.
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Toss the flare down!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Anything you can tell me might help.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Will I be able to walk?
I don't have a title yet.
My pleasure.
I'm getting to believe you.
I know how that can be.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, I hope you like it.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Yes.
No big deal.
Great.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
--cliff-hangers--
Have to wait.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
It's perfect.
What?
No, I haven't.
Three more chapters to go.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What thing?
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Hugh, I'm impressed..
Well that depends.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How do you that.
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
'Thief in the Night?'
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
I hope there's a place to land.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Oh, either way works for me.
Far right.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Indeed.
At least you walked.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Listen to what?
Care to wait a decent interval?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Damn, you're beautiful.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like?
Twice.
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
You mean it'll be difficult.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
She sacrificed herself..
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
She must still be on the property.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
They'll kill me.
So what do you suggest?
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
What about him...?
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
We got it.  On your feet.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Take off your God damn coat!
Who is "they?"
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
You're sure about this?
Sure...
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
The arms dealer.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
I'll get you close.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
Why don't you come back with me?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
We're not outta here yet.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
Give me a break, Pops.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Very well.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
- and picked us up in the States -
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
Jack you're so wicked.
And a lonely ass.
Twenty minutes.
Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
What?
Yes.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
And that's how much I'm saying.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I didn't give you away the first time.
He did?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I don't understand.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Bus hit him.
Just Johnny.
Where are you taking me?
I was dead, too.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
I've never seen a moon like that.
Oh no I didn't!
But he wants me to come!
Come on.
Awful?
I think that's it.
That's right.
Yeah.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
A month from today?
Who is he?
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
If I marry you my mother will die.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
A wife knows.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Oh.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
That's incredible.
Good.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Definitely!
I am alone in the world.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
What do you do?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Don't shit where you eat.
I think it's because they fear death.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
I'm too old for you.
Good night.
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Is who down there?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Oh. Right.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
...What?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
Who are they?
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
No, no ... not "is"!
So be it!
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege,  I am honored.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
I am an enchanter.
There are some who call me Tim?
There.
I warned you!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Who did we lose?
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
What is your quest?
Yes he is.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Is it?
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I'm ... your son ...
... and you'll come and get him.
Got it?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Oh ... hello ...
No, I'm not.
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
How about yourself?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Yeah.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
It is quite late enough.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
We --
Back and upper corridors.
How will I know?
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Quite.
I'm fine.
It's nothing.
This is the top.
I wouldn't know.
I do what I do.
They aren't as watchful as you.
The greasy pole.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Yes, ma'am.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
I'm breaking no promises!
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Yes.
You can't know that for sure.
Of course.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
No, indeed.
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
A few days, ma'am.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
I have no idea.
What is it?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Yeah...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
It's twelve-thirty!
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
You imagined it.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Laurie's.
What?
What?
I can't believe you made it!
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Yes I am...
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
We don't have a choice!
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
And then keep on driving?
That way.
Oh God...oh god...
Is that your question?
Of course I am.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
That's impossible.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
No.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
No problem. What's on your mind?
I agree with what you said...truly.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Well, I ...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
I was afraid of that.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Right. See ya.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
But you won't.
Yes, there was.
May I have your name please?
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
Mulholland Drive?
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Not that I can see.
I'm not sure about this.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
"Then they'd put you in jail."
Okay.
What is it? What do you see?!
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
I just wanted to come here.
This Denny's.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Find out who they are?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Why should I ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm working on it.
What ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
I'm not listening.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
What do you mean ?
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Hey , Hey !
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Not quite....
That's cute asshole.
Knock yourself out.
Yes, sir Mom.
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
Not yet.
Got it.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I'll see that bet.
I can see that but where ?
What happened ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Yahoo !!!!!
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Oh, just put it over there.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about giving the other guy a break.
What do you remember about her.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Have fun.
She just had a baby that's all.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
You mean, you knew about me?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
You're so clever.
MOM!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
What difference does it make?
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Change my name.
What if you don't wanna be found?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
You would.
And I thought I was weird.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Oh no?!?!?!
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
He's an undertaker.
Nick?
This has been a real confusing day.

You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
They're great.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
You want me to come with?
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Phil for God sake.
I was commenting on your hair.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Oh no.
What do you mean?
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
All right, here.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
This guy bonking you?
I'm impressed.
Yeah, all right...
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
What do you mean??
Oh that, she just likes to play.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
I wrote that.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
It's no big deal.
Okay.
Are you mad at me?
Is there enough room?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Any more soda left?
Why?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
No, sweetie, not yet.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Hi.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
There were just too many of 'em.
Get away, get away!!
I'm very nervous.
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Hi, is Vada home?
Thank you. Bye.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Thirty five dollars.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
We'd love to hear it.
Yes it is.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
No, I'm divorced.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Yes!!
I'm eleven and a half.
I will I promise.
Uh huh.
What are you saving for?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Oh no!  UUH.
I'm trying.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It'll bleed.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Don't DO that!!
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I stopped that!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Duck!
Go???
So?
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
I wanna live with them too.
Really?
I don't like her.
Leave then, some friend you are.
I should look different.
The wandering sportswriter.
He's still in love with you.
I have a suggestion...
You've been working on this, huh?
I wish.
Try less appropriate.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
To belong to someone.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Well, we're...
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
Exactly.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has.  So far.
W...
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
I never eat when I'm serene.
Boy, those were the days.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
The night we met.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
Oh, yeah.
... yeah, that.
Shhh.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
That is so romantic.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
An so it is.
What do you have to buy?
I won first prize.
Is there food?
What's wrong honey.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
You're so good.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
He knows better.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
Whose?
Minimum.
D.C.
Bill, he's a crazy man.
What crook?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Harvard?
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
A little. What do you need?
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
What did you say?
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Well, he's really amazing.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Nash.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Does their hair fall out?
No, I don't.
He's a member of our congregation.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I have to go.
Older.
Yea.
What?
Money's no object.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
He's pretty well known down here.
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
What?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Where are you from?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
More or less...
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Yeah.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Thank you, sir.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I can appreciate that.
Lobotomy Bay?
I see.
Ain't love grand.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Not good.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Yeah, we have a van.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
On average forty million.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
So, what now?
NO!!!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Just for fun, I guess.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Wayne---
Rockin'!
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Really?
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
And me.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
See Duff. He's the money man.
That's right.
I been sendin' her money.
Like where?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Where was your father born?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
No. I'm new in town.
What d'you expect?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
That's right.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
You got a problem all right.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
Oh yeah, and then what?
No.
Four.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
What?
How about it?
Yeah?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You still didn't answer my question.
I don't want to hurt you.
You jivin' me?
Yeah.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
You will.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
When I get set, I'll send for you.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
Plannin' on getting married?
I said, she's in great shape.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
No, they won't.
How are you?
Guess it's never been easy.
I guess not.
It ain't in me.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Hi.
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Right here.
You hate Raoul?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
I'm fine.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
And how do you suggest I do that?
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Prepping your trip.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
No problem, amigo.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
How long, Dixie?
I thought you already left.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
Why would you want me to kill you?
What's my end?
Couple of months.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Well, do you?
Nice.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Exactly.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Nope.
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
Yeah.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Jos, that's not what we're --

Hidden camera.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Transitioned?
Do I want to be crunched?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
I know.
wasn't even thinking about-
Thank you.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
Why do you do that?
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
I finally found my story.
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Where?
I know.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
He stayed a long time.
Maybe he doesn't know...
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Oh, please...
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
What about it?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Yeah, why?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
I know.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Whoa!
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
I can't!
No.  I'm okay.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
He's full of shit.
Can't it wait till morning?
He's heavy in the halls...
I don't know.
I think so.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Thank you.
It's been a long time.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Never been here before?
With Hypnocyl?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
So do I.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
For what?
Try me.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
No.  We're alone.
Mary Helena.
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Uh, fourteen.
This is stupid.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Me too.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
Night, night, Honey.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Films mainly.
Fine.
Here, let me help.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Yes.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Okay.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Let's go in.
You abide by rules like that?
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Come in.
Well, get a message through to him too.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Yes.  Always have had.
You have a stunt bottom?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Okay.
What?
Undressed like this, yes.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
What's your name?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Yes, I think that one may be.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
And we intend to use them!
It was good.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Well, thanks, that's great.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
So it could have been neither of them?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
She's perfect, perfect.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
What are the choices?
Point taken.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
And she's in your house.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Yes.
Yes.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
No! No! No!
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
A vote is before the group.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
O-o-o-oh...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
No.
Ca-na-da...
Are they all crazies?
What? Where?
Wow! They're so quiet.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Hey, what's that?
Huh?
Lemme see...
What?
What for?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
I refuse!
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Gary Blinker...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Me. Hit me!
Yeah, Mac?
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Me, too! Me, too!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Oh, what was that?
I see.
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, Mac!
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Okay. How you doing?
What?
Big man!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
After you, ma'am.
Huh?
Now you talkin'.
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
No way...
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
No, she wasn't my sister.
Of course not.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
So.  How do we get to Rome?
--separate, in the evening..."
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
You're sure...
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Oh no.  Do you?
Except possibly that.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
But Faith--
Non.  Please.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I'm in love with you.
You didn't answer my question.
Who says I don't love him?...
Oh.  That's nice.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Yeah.
You aren't?
Well.  Congratulations.
In that case... no...
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
Just since yesterday.
Tonight?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
What?
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
No...  I can just tell.
You don't have a passport.
Maybe.
You're coming with me?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Oh my God.  Where?
Is he looking at us?
What?
I meant about my idea.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
...and a fortune teller.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Yes.  He is.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
I'd love to.
Right.
No.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She didn't give me a chance.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Ten billion to one.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!
Why should he forget it?
It's a living.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Why Edie, I
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Man, you were a mess!
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
How would you've done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
Do you like pigeons?
I only live up there and across the roof.
Good. So do I.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
In a saloon?
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
Who says?
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Get out of my way.
Well, it's over.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Terry...?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
You are like
I don't want to hear it in there.
I'll find you a priest.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
What do you want from me, Father.
Mind your own business, Father.
You go to hell.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
I'm just resting my feet.
You'd be off the pier for good.
Yeah us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Hit me again.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Nothing happened, Johnny.
How'd you get that.
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
What do you mean?
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Keep Charley out of this.
I do not joke in my proposal.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Be careful!--They'll see you.
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
A situation easily remedied.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
You know better than that.
I'm so frightened.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
And the one driving the other car?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Why don't we talk about it later?
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
He ain't the problem, Jack.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Her phone's probably tapped.
Forty-five minutes.
In the trunk, yeah?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Why you think is today?
I don't smoke.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
I wasn't asking permission.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
A little.
I thought so, too.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
You have to be kidding.
Shit...
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Those guys bother you?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
That's not what you were about to say.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I see better with them on.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
When?
You know who they are?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
How are you, Richard?
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
Like what?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
I remember you now.  Shit.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Gimme another hint.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
You a lawyer?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Then they're not separated, are they?
What're you doing at Glades?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Hello?
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
That's right, just me.
I don't have any idea.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Are they dead?
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
Red...Strange?
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
You guys are new?
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
He did.
Kill the bastards!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
What facts are those?
So what are you saying?
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
You were more like brothers.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Thank you, Sir.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Crank her!
Goodbye, Grandma.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Charlie...
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Oh yeah?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
Who?
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
What am I going to do with you?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
How'd you know about that?
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy, touchy!
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I wish she hadn't.
But I'm remembering the future.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
What're you doing here anyway?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
That would be impossible.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
It's not Charlie. It's me.
At my age? Don't be silly.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Please don't shout.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
I don't feel very festive.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You have an incredible memory.
But accidents can happen.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
What was?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
When do we start?
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
Well... uh... thanks...
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Pretty much so.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I'll be fine, Dad.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Zowie.
He pissed me off.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I'm not burying him here...
There's a better place...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
What do you mean?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Go later...
Right here, Mom...
Andy?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
That's not what I said.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
I have AIDS.
Your... lover?
Continue.
Makeup.
As in, the vegetable?
Fine.
What?
What's her name?
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Uh huh...
What have you prayed for?
No. I didn't.
Yes.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Really?
That's right.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Answer the question, please.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
That's correct.
I might.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Probably since she was born.
Okay, Joe...
Night, honey.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Yes, we did.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Helloooo...
Dr. J.!
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... It's time to get this society back on track!
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
<u>What</u>?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Think about what?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
You sure you can keep --
Riddick? How close?
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
I can't....I can't....
Don't do this to me....
Possibly.
Can we switch?
Hey, who?
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
What?
Let's just be sure.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
For your own fear.
We're just burnin' light here.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
You know who Muhammad was?
We're all on the same hajj now.
For now.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Riddick?
What?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
There is no "safe."
I'm born-again.
About the girl.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Right now, if you like.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
What's so special about him?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
No, they won't -
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Zira....
But how long is a day?
None at all.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Show this to the President.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
What signal?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're here to stay.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
long pause) You know it.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Zira doesn't want your female.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
What is it?
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Mind your tongue, madame.
Read it yourself.
With one of them.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Taylor, you can't.
God bless you.
This is his assertion.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
How the hell did he get away?
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Youse so fucked up man.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
Nah...
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.

Not tonight.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Would you mind?
How do you do?
Why certainly, baby.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
How long would that take?
No, please.
As I said before...
He got in here how?
I don't.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
That's putting it mildly.
Just who are you, anyway?
Is this the best you can do?
Couldn't be.
Absolutely sure.
All right--following me.
So have I.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
It is?
Yes.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
You were there when I last saw him.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
What does he see?
Very ridiculous.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Sometimes.
Morning. Any calls?
All right. Get him.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
Got the information on you?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Fascinated.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
Yes, I've seen it before.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I never notice the view after the first week.
I wouldn't know.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
With what motive?
Floater?
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
So it seems Sergeant.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Should be over there.
Pretty big chance, huh?
Well.  What about it?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Oh nothing.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Nice.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
Years, why?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
I say YES!
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
What went wrong?
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I'm not sure I can face it.
Hello.
...break away completely from--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Very thoughtful.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Will it be fun?
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
That's good.
Yes, you said.
No, thanks Dad.
Darling Susan.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
But you're not alone.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
I say when it's over!
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Not so far.
Babes.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Thanks, buddy.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Figured you did.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Catch of the day.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Something... in the trees...
Like the old days, Dillon.
Who's our back-up on this?
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
We're going to need everyone.
We're not going.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
What's that, General?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Twenty-five percent.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
Storage, I think.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
The price just went up to ten.
No.
What motel you staying at?
For an hour.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Why?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Diet coke.
I've known a lot of everybody.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Mmm, I could tell.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
All right, two thousand.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I got a dress, yeah.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Television?
I have work to do.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Please.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
Shall we mingle?
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Vivian...
I'll guard them and you with my life.
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We're letting them slide?
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
Yes...
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Give me twenty minutes.
Yes.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
He's not gonna want us.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Will I like it?
What if they serve soup?
Excuse me?
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
'Scume me.
Do you remember me?
Yeah.  Thanks.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Then why bother curing me?
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
As you wish.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
And a good thing too.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Who's Guilder?
Anybody want a peanut?
Veer left. Left. Left!
I'm waiting!
-- what? --
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Right, right, sorry.
I'll be right back.
-- well, when does it get good?
You want me to read this or not?
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Who won? How did it end?
Of course.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
In that case --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
I ought to be after twenty years.
Get used to disappointment.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You know what a hurry we're in.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
I smell nothing.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
A good hour. Yeah.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
"Keep a shining in...
Well, sir, it seems ...
Where?  What?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Only if we ask him.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
To failure!
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Liebkind, no!
What is it?
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Really, I never dreamed ...
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Come on.  Let's get going.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Got dag pa dig.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
By the sacred memory...
Bismark...
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Where are you going vit the light?
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
No.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
What?
How early?
She isn't still here, is she?
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Anyone at home?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Who are you, friend?
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
What?
All right.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
What difference does that...
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Yes.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Sam, I'm going.
Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Neither will I.
Of course we will.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
I could stand something regular.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Sam. This is the last time.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I have to go, Sam.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I'm thinking of it.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
I have?
No.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Oh I do... but I say I don't.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
Norman.
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
I'm sorry.
Now what?
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Maybe you saw Mary!
Arbogast.
I suppose you want a cabin.
Haven't any.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Did she talk?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
You found Buckley?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Well, news of Buckley?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
How? What can I do?
I'm losing my blood!
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Delighted, I'm sure.
Thank you.
I'd love to, at any time.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
The body of Joan Gale!
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else.
Nope, I'm through!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
How's every little thing?
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
It's all yours.
Horsefeathers!
Cry-baby?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
You go in for dangerous things.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Heaven knows. A lot.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
He can't hear you.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Yes....
I could go out of town.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
So I can move on.  You too.
Where is she?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
All right, what do you know?
Well... maybe...
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
She's watching the car again?
Okay.
Is that all?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
I think we both know her.
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
What time is it?
Is she all right?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Well, it has buttons.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
What's the use, there ain't none.
You mean a farm?
Mine.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
She has other things to do, Dave.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
You can stop it right now.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
More history, Rose.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
It'll get better now.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
You're not gonna see him again.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Again.
That wasn't my fault.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Yeah.
What?
Entertainers don't count.
They shot us all, kid.
You don't smoke.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
No, but it should.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
You're lying...
Nope.
There probably is.
You going rogue on me?
You can't be serious.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Well, sir...
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
It's our job.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Let's hope.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
I know it is, even if you don't.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Billy!  Billy!
Know what I love about dynamite?
They're... around.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't kill my own father.
But I have no sister.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
That's all any of us can see.
Lower it!
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
All right, hang on.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
We shall double our efforts.
Your Royal Highness.
Oh, no.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
But, why must you confront him?
Never-r-r!
Your father he is.
Oh. Well, yes.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I told you, my car broke down.
Janet.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Dammit, Janet.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
We must have a blow-out.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Yes.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You know this earth - this person.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
Makes you cry
So come up to the Lab.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
...I'm sorry.
...I suppose.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think you're a bum.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
I don't think I belong here.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Christ.
Don't talk like that to him!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Fouls.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
I agree.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
Do I have to pay juice?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Yeah.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Ya got heart.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I got pain an' experience too.
Real good.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
It ain't your locker no more.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Ain't had time to check 'em.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I'm thirty myself.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Whatta these guys want?
Maybe --
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
He's a Toon... who cares?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Doom.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
As soon as is humanly possible.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Me.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Safe?
Get away from there.
Forget it.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I rest my case.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Art thou hurt?
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Well, what was yours?
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
I thought all for the best.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
What wouldst thou have with me?
I am for you.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
What?
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
And then...
How do we know that?
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Duty calls?
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Don't do it, Sam!
I think not.  After you...
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
How did you know?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
I didn't expect that he would.
What a surprise...
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
No thanks.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Yes.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Very ugly.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You think?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Finish the job...
What?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Gone.  Destroyed.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
Why didn't you kill him?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You slept with the fucker!!
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
The Russian would be easier.
Never heard of it.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Why?
We'll figure something out.
What makes you so sure?
Maybe.  Who cares?
Torch it?!
He saw everything!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
That's not what I mean.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
No.  It's not.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Nothing.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I love you too.
He's not, he's...
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
You know I do.
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Well I just uh, you know...
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
So be here at three.
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Right behind you.
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Anything in it?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I don't think so.
This is your ship?
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
I said get on your feet!
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
I don't think so...
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Try to land on your feet.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Who died?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Good at what?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
You said --
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
What is it?
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
Fine by me.
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
End of the line.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
MMMMMM!!!!
I did!
No problem.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
The Plaza Hotel?
I need your help.
I'm fine.
Baby Duck?
Any leads?
It's my responsibility.
Are you okay, Lee?
Don't.
The police can protect you.
Yes, Master.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
Ricky Tan?
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
A little.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Stooly.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
It's him.
Going into the restaurant.
I am from outa town.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
The Feds?!
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
It's okay. For restaurants.
At this point we don't have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Don't play bullshit games with me.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Or somethin'.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
You bet ya, Coach.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Where do you think she's going?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
I don't know.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
And you defending her?
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
That must have made you proud.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
-- The luau for Maggie.
You'll answer my questions?
Yes.
Without oxygen...
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Still sweet.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Of what?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Missed me bad, huh?
Yes.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
Me?
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
Is there somebody else?
He's got a houseboat.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year.
Walter, I'd love to --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
You couldn't.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
I think that's what I'm saying.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
What?
What was what?
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
Is this crazy?
Good night.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
Any time.
How amazing.
Mom!
It's a sign.
Hello.
It's me?
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
She died.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
I don't know.  Do I?
It plays in 50 states.
Stressed.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
It's only ten o'clock.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Victoria? She's okay.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Shut up.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
You must be Jonah.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
What do you mean?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
He's good at it.
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
No, Estellita.
Yes. We will light the candles.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
What has it got me, your union?
I'm a fool.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He'll have it good. Some day.
No.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Like what?
Will you be still?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
You mean Delaware?
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
I thought maybe you forgot...
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
What attitude?
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
I was talking to my wife.
Not even a guess?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
I try.
You really need to lighten up.
This has nothing to do with him.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
Please open the door, Danny.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You always been this stubborn?
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Guess it's our turn.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
When? When did you ever see me use?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
Hey, okay.
Anything for a dear friend.
Why do you say that?
Big Bill.
Big Bill
Okay! Okay!
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
It speaks!
What's he holding?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
You mean the menacing red car?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
And you've got wiener breath.
There's no motels around here.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Just admit you're wrong.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Don't worry about it.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
In West Fork?
No kidding.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Keep trying.
White-walls?
Senator's son?
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
You know classical music?
Sure, you got one?
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
I've got a line on one.
Hell of a mission.
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
Is it getting worse?
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Bits and pieces.
You're welcome, John.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
You have orders, too.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
But we accomplish the mission.
See to it.
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Alright, come with me.
Yeah?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Captain, he's fast!
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Get lost.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Who knows?  It worked.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Because he's guilty.
Understanding the following rights...
Good for her.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Hey, sis.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
He's a mess!
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
What's a scam?
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd.
That's just so embarrassing.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Meaning?
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Goodnight.
I like him a lot.
Swear to god.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Alright.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Hmmm....
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
That's cool then.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
What did you say?
Be friends?
Am I wrecking my car?
This is so noble.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
Your letter came yesterday.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What's wrong?
No, I don't, I don't.
No.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Oh shit.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Hello Lloyd.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Yeah.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Oskar, please -
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
That's great.
There's nothing in the stores.
Yeah.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Wine?
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Something they can hold in their hands.
They should be.
Would it do any good?
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
On national television.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Stop it...
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
Don't forget to set the alarm.
I live here.
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
You have a right to be angry.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
And Joel's pre-med.
No, wait here.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Whatever.
I'm everywhere.
Stay away from the cop.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Yeah, right.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
Gale?
But she's standing right next to you.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Don't panic.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Hello.
Who is this?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Closer than you think.
To see your reaction.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Catch him, or kill him.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
What Rielly?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Fuck!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
But you know who she was.
Sure.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
What the hell are you doing?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Who?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Who's this.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Huh, fine.
Roman that's not the line.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Who is this?
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Oh...
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
I'll only stay a sec.
You have to move on, Sid.
Or even a good porno.
I called my dad.
You don't still think it was me?
Are you alone in the house?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
What number is this?
Do I?
I want to talk to you for a second.
You're making popcorn?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
You have to have a favorite.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
More of a game, really.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
That all depends on you.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
YES!
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
No, not yet.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Then what are you doing here?
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Yes, you doofus.
Not yet.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Have you contacted the bureau?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
What is it? Where's Casey?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Just stay back.
Forget it.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Twice.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
And what would be your motive?
No, Sid.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
What happened?
Do they know who did it?
It's past seven.
He was there, Tatum.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I bet he's pissed.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, god...
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
I don't know, they just did.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
I'm in.
Announcing what?
No, I haven't heard.
It's always been like this.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
I read about it in the paper.
I'll see you.
Her pretty head.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Murderers?
Murderers like you?
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
What the fuck is going on here?!
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
For now.
Guessing at this point is useless.
No.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
Can we talk about this in private?
What?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Punishing.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
It's got to be.
Oh, that's all.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
And so what?
What?  Assessing fines?
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
Big surprise.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
What did you say?
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I'm sorry, I only...
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
You should look into private schools.
I hate this city.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
I ain't wearing no gun.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
How far's the river from here, Mose?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Grab hold!...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
You got it with you?
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Leggo...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Oh...
He just couldn't wait...
Not no more.
It's what I'm countin' on.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
You've seen her!...She's alive?
From the beginning...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Come on, say it.  You know...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Oh God, Tommi...
Yes, daddy.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
What?
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
But what is the truth?
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
No Juliet?!
When I have fifty pounds.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
On my mother's side the Ardens
Who is that?
Oh, that.
it will be all right, madam.
As soon as I have found my muse
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Who wrote that?
Fifty pounds? What for?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
How will it?
Burbage says you have a play.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Do you think?
A different one you haven't written?
"Is the day so young?"
I will.
I am not so well-born.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Your Majesty
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"Madam!"
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Is she obedient?
But the plague
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Oh--I am him too!
It is strange to me, too.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Mr. Henslowe?
I must. I must
You lie.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Orsinogood name
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
But why me?
I will do my duty, my lord.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
It is only ours you can know.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
A theatre poet?
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
About what?
I don't have time.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Think about it.
Juliet?
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
I don't know.
There was a break-in.
What's wrong?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
What does it look like?
Well, then?
What?
Yes.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
David?
Open it.
What? What's wrong?
Don't look?
OK.
Then let's spend some money.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Where he can't get it?
You're frightened.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
What?
did you hear anything before he cries?
Who said there were four?
No, three. Who said there were four?
That wasn't a question.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
I'm sorry.
What?
And you need your sleep.
What happened to that guy?
You must be Juliet.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No.
I'm a doctor.
A certain weakness.
I mean, that's what it's like.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
My keys.
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
What about?
Yes.
Hello.
Yeah.
No thanks.
Why?
I am not like my mother!
Buffums?
I've got heads here, Norman.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Probably the bathroom.
Yeah, I think so...
You did, didn't you?
I don't want to... I swear...
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
Nothing.
-- yes, you --
Not me, pal.
-- well you better go after her.
Don't leave me...
No, man.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- how did you get here?
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
What're you talking about?
You said somebody... who?
What?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
What about me?
I am?
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Okay.
Going where?
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Ha, ha.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I do, Jill.
Oh, Christ.
Where did this come from?
I just want to know, that's all.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
-- no, it'll help me, really --
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Well, yeah.
Okay.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... this doing hair it's...
Oh, hey...
But...
What, do you think I planned it?
I know.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Wasn't sure it was you.
What do you mean?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
Don't be silly.
But you have problems?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Jackie --
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- never mind.
He's a hairdresser.
I don't think so.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
That's fine --
No.
Have they sat down?
Where to, Les?
Yes?
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
You mean they ate each other up?
Okay.
Do you feel bad?
I guess so.
What do you mean?
No, Dad.
No.
French Fries and Ketchup.
How does he tell you things?
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Try to think what it was.
Is there something bad here?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Okay, Mom.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Okay...oh!
Are you having a bad dream?
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Do I have to?
Yes.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Thank you for saying so.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
Your money's no good here.
What time is it?
Yeah... that's all it is.
Yes, I did.
Yes.
Jack...
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Jack...
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy give me the bat.
Go away from me.
Wendy...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Well, my predecessor in this job
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Oh, I'll say.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
Fine.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Where's Mom?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
What's that?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
What?
What kind of noises?
Yeah.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
What?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
But Uncle Al! You said-
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Really?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What?
You did what?
Good evening, Vincent.
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Because we're
Mary Robert.
I knew that.
You re okay -- for a civilian.
What?  What time is it?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Three years.  Sister.
What?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Are you sure?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
You watch yourself!
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Honey.
Keep moving!
It's true!
Enough joking.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
You mean black people?
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
No problem.
I'm outta here.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
What do you mean?
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
Oh?
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
How?
I think they'd understand.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Really.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Maybe.
It's a bluff, Vince.
It didn't work, Vince.
Willy -- hit the lights.
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
We're losing it.
Yes?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Really...
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
She wasn't a nun?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
To place it inside its coffin.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You will stay at her side?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
They need guidance.
Master Hardenbrook...
Well... that might be... helpful.
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
Chosen me?
Believe?
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
What happened?
We should go.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
What does it mean?
Lady Van Tassel.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Tired.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Are you so superstitious?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
No, but... why do you ask that?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
The skull is gone.
What did he say, Katrina?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
What would you have me believe?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
He moves too fast.
His horse.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Doctor, he is awake.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I like them french-fried potaters.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Good to know you, Karl.
What you got that's good to eat?
What you got in there, warshing?
It's too big.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
Please Doyle, don't.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
I thought I told you to keep out!
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
You told me to come by.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
All right then.
If you want me to.
Naw.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
He ain't no count.
I don't reckon I know.
Naw.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
I reckon.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
He ain't ever okay to me.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
Yes, I guess you are.
I want to come back and stay here.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw.
Yes sir.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
All right then.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
What's that you say?
Did you knock on the door yet?
How long have you been standing here?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon not.
Oh. How about before that?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
Can I help you, sir?
Before they were married?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
It's my birthday.
Better make it charge.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
What's that, Sol?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
The Queen of England?
Yeah, I did.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Fuck you, kid.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Yeah, probably.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I mean, it's a good story.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You don't give up, do you?
You what?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
And what's that supposed to mean?
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Why don't you open it and find out?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
And why the hell would you give me money?
Huh?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
And these?
I think I'll take them.
The refrigerator?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
And his parents?
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
And you told your nephew about it?
Jesus.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
I owe you something.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
The what?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Is your father an artist?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
What time is it?
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
His only copy?
That's it. In a nutshell.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
That's obvious.
You don't.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Well, it seems to me...
Why?  We're only talking.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
And the next one...?
And the last...?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Pretty darn clear.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Yes, he was.
To my father.  Everything counts.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Maybe...?
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
I'll take two.  One for later.
I should show them an American?
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Sure, anything's poss...
Not in those words.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Get lost, will you?
All right, girls - from the top again.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
No we're not.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Hey, Joe!
With you.
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
Knock it off, will you?
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
As far away as possible.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Fight it.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message.
That's right.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Security.
Like right after the ceremony.
Get me Room 414.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
We're not on the pier yet -
Good night, honey.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
Interesting.
I have a very low resistance.
I'm fine.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Thank you, Daphne.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
Vanity Fair?
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
I met one of them.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
- you got to be blonde -
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Help yourself.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Bull fiddle.
Pleased to meet you.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
We won't breathe a word.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Where did he conduct?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I'll say.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Good night, Sugar.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
My fault.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
What theory?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
What?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Bon voyage.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
It's the crews' night off.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
They just sort of leave me cold.
What happened?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Good morning.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Why?
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Pub Golf?
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Actually, I do.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Why, with you.
Oh, dont be that way.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Um, just about everyone.
I had to say something to get you here.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Oh, hello.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
Not for a dog.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
You stand on your tiptoes.
A weekend?
Okay.
Show me.
Desperation?
Make out with you for free.
Yeah.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Thank you.
You knew?
Just drunk enough.
Hard.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
You don't live around here, do you?
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Uh huh...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
But where is my daddy!?
Yes, mam...
She was dirty and wet...
No, Miss Johnson...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Here, put my jacket over you.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yes, sir...
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
What happened afta that?
Come here, son...
Mornin', Daddy...
Thank you, Daddy...
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Yes mam...
Children, come here...
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
Yes, ma'm...
Come in, children.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
They probly thought you was crazy.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Little chilly.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
I am the clitoris.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Eric!
I said -
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Sheet!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
No way.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Yes, hon?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Hey, Chef.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Uhh...
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
We can't leave without you!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Yeah, they suck.
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Don't call me dumb!
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
That's nice, Stan.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
He's shutting off the air!!!
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Oh yeah...
Anna...
They're not going to make it!
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
You better start making sense!
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
That's clear.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
Yeah?
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
I'll do my best.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Over and out.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
That is one of my priorities.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
The engines!
One moment please...  one moment please...
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
That's affirmative.
Can I get you something for the road?
He's my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Wait! That's an aria!
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Theo.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
The small ball.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Don't say that about my mom!
He says that to all his wives.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Look who's talking!
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Yippy!
They suspended me.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Where can I find him?
Coming right up.
Won't your father help you with that?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Really? I kinda like it.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
...lane six. Yes.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Too late for what, Sheila?
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
He's my father.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It?
I feel sick.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Please, Dr. Levine.
I can't...
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
What is it?
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
He's right beneath us.
Pull it, damn it!
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Nothing else.
It's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
When was this?
-- and then brought her down here --
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
Pull it.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Nothing, sir.
What the hell is going on here?
They've left, keep watching!
A break for what?
Please watch your closest monitor...
How do you mean, strange?
He understands me fine.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Radiation shield, you think?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Too big?
Underwater?
Yeah.  Drowning.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What are they?
What?
Still clear.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Antibiotic.
Causes sleep.
How long does it last?
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
Where are you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
No, he isn't.
No, he can't.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Get away from the door, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
What?
Beth --
By the bunks.
For whoever's in that thing.
Like what?  I'm not --
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Wait a second, I --
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
To what?
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
Am I?
What is it, Harry?
What are they?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
What happened to her?
You didn't say that about the food?
I'm trying.  There.
Think about it.
"We are friends".
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
What was that, sir?
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
You mean you don't know?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
You seen my suitcase?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
I'm beginning not to like you.
You could put it that way.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
You mean I generate an energy field?
He's bluffing...
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Yes, sir.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Was this trip really necessary?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
You don't believe in the Force?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Why didn't you say so before.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Come back here... Where are you going?
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
With four casualties?!
He'll be well cared for.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
It's what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
I didn't see him !
We're the old men, Ace.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
You got it bad.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I'm getting better.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Only when I give you an order.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
They revoke our flight status.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
Who ?
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I'll meet you outside.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Shhh...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
Alright, I love you.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
How are you, Carl ?
We've gotta go get her !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Uh, no.
You can never be sure.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
What is it, Rico ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Give'em hell, sir !
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
You may proceede.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Departure angle.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
This served the purpose.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
There is no alternative.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
I'll be there.
Sure plan to.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Who?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
You quit.
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
It was either that, or a sardine.
Everyday things...yes.
Surest thing you know.
I love your script.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
<u>Yes</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Yes.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Cast stood me up.
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
I don't drink.
Read the card.
You believe that?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
It used to be the Old Mill.
<u>Please</u>...
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
It does?
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
If I go to jail...?
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
We'll work it out...
Well, then, what's he doing here?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
What'll I do for fun?
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Sure, what have you got?
I...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
We've got three days to...
She's a...
You can go...
Joe, the writer?
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
I think he's moved...
Then what is the...?
She's absolutely r...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
But we...
I...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yes, yes, but...
Is...Is the Movie!
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
We, we have to give it.
I'm only trying to...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
I'll put the, in your r...
That isn't very nice.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He told you that...
My wife just went into labor...
He should be put in jail.
Sure.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I can only write on a manual.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I left that for you.
That's what I said.
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
We don't have the money.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Is that one hell of a kid?
There's no witnesses...
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
...the city council...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
I'll be there for you.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Maybe twenty.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
I'm not.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
And this is my room so get out!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
Cos she loves you.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Where are you, anyway?
Mom...?
Thursday's fine...
You have the WORST flu since...
Oh.
I helped.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
You think I didn't get that?
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Not to me.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Just not to me.
To make it easier for them or you?
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
We're going to win this.
A lot smaller.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Anxiety.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
Nobody likes a snoop.
Ironic, huh?
You're a cross-dresser.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Aw.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Jesus.
For what?
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Rache, get out of th...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Rache, it may take time.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
I'm gonna get me a drink.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
What?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Oh, yeah?
What?
Oh.
Thanks, Scoob.
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
I'm always working.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
I know!
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
The same.
Yeah?
One in a million recover.
Sure, Dad.
Take off your top.
Say, Ni...
Again!
Again!!
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Oh, I don't remember that...
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Hunh.
You should be.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
He did?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
What happened!
What happened?
There's the fence...
What are you talking about?
Like where--in your dreams?
Yes, you should.
Shut up!
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
He's in there...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
How much do they have?
Excellent...excellent!
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Dissent?
What does that mean?
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
What kind of trouble?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Just a squirt.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
What?
War?
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Maximum ECM!
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
I think they mean business.
Yeah?
Ready, Major.
I've got one.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
First safety.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Recall what mistake?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
Roger.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
I don't anymore.
Knock yourself out.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
A cloud?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
And your mom.
What?
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not worried.
No, I mean, no one.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Jeff! Let's go!
So, how was the ride, kids?
Sure I am. It's fun.
In what way?
Buff is funny. God.
I will.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
No, no, whoa!
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Yeah.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
It's nice here. It's different.
Military marching bands.
Really?
You cut off your little finger?
Let's see.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Yeah?
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Ask your girlfriend.
What?
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
That chick, Erica?
Oh, shit.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Look, your trespassing.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
It's a piece.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
About what?
One!
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
I would've stopped it.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Us.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Nothing.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
For a ride.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Well, what about us?
Oh, no, no, no.
What?
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Well, not exactly.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
You know what I'm saying?
Burnfield. No place like it.
I don't know.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Yeah.
New York, huh?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah.
That was so great!
You done?
I can't believe you're still here.
If...
You do?
Oh, my god!
Really? What else does your mother say?
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Whatever.
Don't do that.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Come on, Jeff.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
No car.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Yeah.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
That was gas, Sweetie.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Well, I want to know what happened --
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
He Ikea'd us.
Kim-Lo?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
You're kidding.
Hold on...
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I hear she was a terror to work with.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
What's wrong with it?
I just think pictures should say a little something.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Phillip, you're mad!
We're engaged.
Nobody can be that busy.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Nice job.
It must be my new shampoo.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
You did.
Come on, Joe.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Fair enough.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
I don't know.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Come here!
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
What's that?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
This is the right day.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
I ran into some people I knew.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I went for a walk.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Good.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Yes, Madame.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But where?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
No, a super girl.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's for your own protection.
Later.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Why not ?
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
What do you feel about me?
But why?
I don't see why not.
Well, there's several ways to go .
A passionfruit smoothee.
What an adorable hat.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
I've got things to do.
Oh, no thanks.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Oh, sure.
How do you know?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
But what for?
It was just a trim.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
What? Me?
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
I knew it!
Then come with me.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
There's no vodka in it.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
It sure is.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Can I help?
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Mom and I do this all the time.
What!
Oh?
Mmmmm . . .
First paycheck?
So where is all them half-centses?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Yeah. A raise . .
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
What are you talking about, fella?
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
What will it do?
Sister! I'm his sister!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Gus?
In other words, push this red button.
Hello.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Where did it come from?
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
She'll be fine.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Really?
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Lois, you're amazing.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Maybe you wanted to.
We'd better talk.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Uh...home...
What else is ballast for?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It's beautiful.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
My kind of people.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Constantly.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Cuba.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
DELETE IN CUTTING
What shall we do now?
I really don't think . . .
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
What about here?
Like me?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
I'm sorry.
Absolutely!
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
Something . . . wonderful.
But why the hair?
You're just an experiment, freako!
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
This wasn't in the plan.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Bunkers!
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
I've been on the job.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
North. It's north
Not really, no.
But otherwise it's swell.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Don't you ever give up?
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
There was a recipe on the back  --
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Tea?
But so is Vond-El
All of us.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
He'll be weightless.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
What about it?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Are you still in touch?
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
No you don't.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
I'm not sure.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
Why not?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Sure.
I better get back.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Why?
Well I don't.
Yes.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
For rabbits?
You talked about it?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Yes.  He does.
I did.
Yes.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
Did he say what about?
Yes.
Okay.
What, Mason?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
You hate that.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
Was the bus on time?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
There's the Prescots...
No.
Tell me about it.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Yes.
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Who are you?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Do you have this agreement with you?
In what way?
Any criminal record?
Yes.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
You mean it?
Don't even try to remember.
The ramp?
Very slick.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
The Ottos.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Hitler!
Is "he" inside?
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Why?
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
I don't believe it.
I didn't say that, J.J.
I'll listen one more minute.
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
No, I won't...
Can't hurt...
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Don't go wild, Sidney.
She knows now.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
I hate to see you like this --
I know you do, Sidney.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Like you?
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
If the stores are open -
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
No one must follow your work.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
I would.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
No problemo.
Remember what I said, you can't...
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
And what it that?
Unknown.
Then what?
Why attack Russia?
No.  There is another chip.
I don't know.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Five minutes.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Yes.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
This is absolute nonsense!
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
How could I forget?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Yeah?
One of my people?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
First oboe.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
You're a big help.

We will, kiddo.
That's none of your business.
What's it to ya?
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
The what?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Kyle...
Why?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Now, look...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Did you?  Kudos.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
No.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
You?
Wha... ?
Get out of my car!
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What... what do you mean?
... what... ?
We searched the house.
Like... where are you from?
Underwear?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They'll be wanting it back.
This isn't an escort service?
Are you still on mediction?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Yes.
Yes, very lucky.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
Yes.
I'll call.  I really will.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What's all this for?
Humor me with specifics.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Like, this way... sort of...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Fine.
I'm not sure.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I know who she is.  Take a message.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Don't ask.
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
What?
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Why?
Just stay there, Nell!
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
I don't know.
It was.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
Test it.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Mary came with me.
How could you do this to people?
Nell, what do we do?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Why would we --
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
It's all I could afford.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Well?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I have a loft.
Is that a problem?
Who?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
We'll find him.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
This ain't your lot?
I only asked.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Not me, man.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
You goin' back inside?
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Not much -- you?
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Not her brand.
That's not what I heard.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not embarrassed.
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Up the coast.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
How do you know?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
All of what?
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
-- You know his name is Frank.
Who's looking for you?
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Yes, Ann?
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Who?
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...Uh-huh.
Huh.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Huh.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
No. I--tell me--
Maybe.
That'll be fine.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Who?
How's that?
Congratulations, Gina.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I took Doris's keys.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...who among us is in a position to say...
OK. Boy. Jesus!
So--
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Uh-huh.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
OK.
...Nah.
Huh? No.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
You'll go to the prison hospital.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
No.
Great.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Hurry up!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Apparently it's huge.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
All right everybody, hold up!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
I'm not giving up.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Footsteps!
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
Another storage room.
Frock's been fired.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
I don't understand.
You were going to be married.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
I have to shoot.
<i>A month.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
Why wouldn't I?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
Why would we--
Do it!
Thank you.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Shhh!
Oh, yes.
Yeah...
Truman, you're gonna be late!
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
How do you know?
You hate gambling.
I bet you did.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Oh, just so.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Who?
Were you there--how do you know?
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
You can count on it.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
You're not FBI agents.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Looking for him for what?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Show you right on a map.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
I know the name. Why?
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
How?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
I'm not sure. A virus --
What did it look like?
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
All I told them was the truth.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
I'd been told as much.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I don't know.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
I don't know, Mulder.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
I have no idea.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have his number.
Thank you.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Where's Scully?!
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
How deep does this go?
I have answers for you.
Yes.
Driver.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Shush.
Yes mother.
I don't need them anymore...
Give a kiss to Edward.
You're sure of that?
Like hell "wait."
Little boy?!  That's him!
I got it.
Delano?
Initiating connection.
I'll get her...
Yes.
No.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Dr. Kent.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
Ja, ja, ja.
Do you understand German?
Yes.
He was Harry's driver?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
I don't know.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Oh, the usual things...
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
There's nothing in them.
I don't know.
They'll be returned, miss.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
When did you see him last?
Once in a while.
What?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Bring him in.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
How about the doorway?
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
I said you win.
Well, there's not much time.
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
No, I don't know...
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
I know a very good dentist.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Why not?
You've got plenty of contacts.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
What do you want?
Coffee.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
But you will.
Hear the details.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Yes.
Yes.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
I am not a bad man.
Funny?
Not necessarily.
Joseph Harbin.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Help you out?
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Thanks.
We're ok.
I'm sorry.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
So?
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
They don't have extermination camps.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
I don't, but...
Fire...
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
People still need values, beliefs....
I just read it....
Oh, really?
Why won't you talk to me?
He's at a home out here.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Don't curse in front of it.
Do they?
Lina, come here!
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
They're liars and cowards.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I agree.
I don't know. Is that right?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Are all Jews the same?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
What were you, following me?
Get the fuck away from me.
To hear them read Torah.
I can't say that.
It's German.
Steve...
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
I've got to get back to the --
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Where?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Shut up...
I was a Jew in a previous life.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes.
What kind?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
The documents are forged.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
I think I'll have a coffee.
In a lake.
What was he like, when he was little?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
What are you doing here?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Then tell him to wax it too.
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
He's training.
Noireuter.
Fine!
No...
Enzo...
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
What?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
... And his friend, Johana...
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
... Yes.
Thank you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
You say that because you have the title!
I can't.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Who?
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
... The way she moves.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
No... tell me.
You'll understand.
You go back, I'll walk.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
No.
Well... here.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Of course, that's what they're for.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Please, call me Mordechai.
Yeah, no kidding.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
Nice fellow?
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Charlie likes his leopard.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Yeah.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
What! You can't be --
I know -- Teresa -
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Disney! How inter...
You... You found that at Leons?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
No!
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
...Were turning in circles.
Here we go again.
Simplify and damn.
You seem to know what youre talking about.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Where is he?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
The company. We all work for the company.
B-Black...
I certainly did, sir...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Its not.
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his.
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
Recommended?
Okay. Recommended...
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Anything at all?
Is my money in there?
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
Should I come back in five minutes?
The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
An Austrian.
How are you, Rhian?
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Shut up!
Im afraid I dont understand.
Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
Er... Yes...
... No.
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Hows the boy doing?
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
I know his work better than I know him.
What about his girlfriend?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Tu sais où me trouver.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
If he had, youd be dead.
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Thats what he said...
Cost what?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Yes, my lord.
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
Do you think I could have some water?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Now?
Now?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
I promise...
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
I want to stay with you...
I'm staying, Jean.
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
I don't know...
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Performing a miracle.
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not long ago...
Yes...
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Buying her?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
Go and ask him yourself.
Yes.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Yes... they were.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
No good?  This is a disaster!
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
No...
No...!
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
I'd sooner die than use magic!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I -- I -- I...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I might ask you the same question.
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
So your memory's coming back?
Really?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
He never says his name.
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Why did she have to die?
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Who wants me to stop?
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Just over a year.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Yes, please.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
We use what?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Yes, so did the Germans.
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are always notices going up.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Bitch!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
God forbid!
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
We're getting out.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch your feet!
Yes, like a cave.
... without a shred of manners.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Yes, it's unholy.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
The piano.
You mean in signs?
No, not words.
They are washed.
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Do I know any gigs?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
That's right.
Billie.  You ready?
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Don't worry about it, pal.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
Who's got the contract?
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
You sober?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Why?
What do ya mean?
No, not a thing.
Did he hold you up on anything?
I thought I'd lost him.
It was too noisy.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
The wire is ten years outa date.
I also gotta win.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Five and call.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
But what about all these other people?
Think nothin' of it.
Where's June today?
Sixty-five.
No.
Yeh, this time anyway.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Then why the rat?
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You got a system, Carver?
Let me talk to him.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
No.
Don't think I know him.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
For fifteen years.
Never heard of the place.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
He'll never do it.
No.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
He was?
Is that what it means?
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
It's all right.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Said he stole his invention.
Another young man.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
You're talking like a crazy person,
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Macaulay.
Yes, she would.
What would your mother say to that?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
A new invention?
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
What'd he think it was to you?
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
I think we're on the right track.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Well, what?
No.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
All right.  All right.
So I see.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Go ahead!
You're going to return every cent of it!
What did you do with the rest?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Never mind.
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Slim.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Well, don't you?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
I didn't knock Julia off.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
This is your party.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
I had him out this morning.
Oh, this is Andy --
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
That last Martini.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Maybe I will.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
That's a fact.
Sure.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Got a nice evening dress?
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Yes.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
No, Mr. Charles.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Yes.  Nick!
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home!
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
Oh, God.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
We can't just go off and--
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Ready when you are.
What about the gold?
Maybe we should split it up now.
He's an enemy soldier.
No.
What if I do?
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
I have to answer him.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
What are you doing?
There might be something in there.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Millionaires, man.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I heard it click.
I heard it.
We're going to be right over here.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Stay low.
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
We'll lie.
Sure.
Makes two of us.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
The...the gold...
When did you make the switch?
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Now you need me.
Like I said; so?
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Oh, no.
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, Jesus!
Yeah, well, we're not.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
I think we found something.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Correct.  Origin?
Violation?
What happened?
4732...?
Vocasity
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Looks like dirt.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
It's 3+27 hundred
No!  Don't go.
Don't take anything.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Don't let them separate us.
They don't know.
No one can see us now we're alone.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
What?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
No......  She's dead THX........
I thought of something.....
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
You should know better than that!
-Where?
No thanks, Bev.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Yep.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
`Til we get a better lead.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Where you guys at?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Me, too.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
Easy, guys.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
It's from an IRA.
We work fast enough for you?
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
We've created a monster.
Thank you.
Security.
Take him!
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
I don't know...
Fuck factor ten.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
That feeling won't last long.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
I know.
And it had diamonds in the back.
And diamonds in the front.
Diamonds all over.
About tonsils.
Amsterdam?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Umm.
The type they marry.
I thought so.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron?
Yes, Baron. Thank you.
Um-hum ...
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Otherwise I'll call the police
No--no.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
No, thank you.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
What?
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes!  Now don't worry!
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
Not particularly.
Oh! You didn't read it!
M'sieu Laval!
Right!
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
You think that's too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
How do you like my dress?
Good night.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
I <u>must</u> go.
On the night table.
No--thirty-five!
Yes, Gaston?
I don't believe it!
Please!  Thank you.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I don't want your money!
But you saw it here.
Well, where is it?
That's right.
The pumps --
Thank you, Rose.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Rose Calvert.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
She knows.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
What do I tell your mother?
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
We've struck ice.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
You're crazy.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
He does landscapes.
To the stars.
This is crazy.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I know, I know.
I'll be right back.
We'll find out.
Right.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Goodbye, mother.
Sure!
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
I don't understand.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Very much--
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
So you washed it off!
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
I'll be waiting on deck.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
I'll watch for him, sir.
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Change?
Are you screwy?
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Partners, ain't we?
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
It's a pleasure.
I wouldn't be surprised--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
Why?
I should say not.
She did?
What's that?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Back is in New York.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's fine.
I was never stiffer in my life.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Is this your gun?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I'll never love anybody else.
Very serious?
I'm getting seasick--
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
"Smooth's" the word.
What's the matter?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
What!--are you crazy?
Hey--you! Where you going?
Then why did you run away?
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Isn't that a daisy?
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Beauty, ain't he?
Come and get him.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
This brand.
Well... 'bye.
Here it come: one-two-
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
No...
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
All right, Doc...
All right.  Then what?
Sorry...
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
What was that all about?
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Where do you get these questions?
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
I didn't mean it that way.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
No really, I can stay a while.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
You wanted to talk?
That what you got me up here for?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
I'll be damned...
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
What're you talkin' about?
I know.  And nobody can make him.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
You're on.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
I know, I need a keeper.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Yeah, and dangerous.
We'll see about that.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Is that any way to say hello?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Shhhhh...
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Not from forty feet.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
He tied one on.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Three. You? Married?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
- You're not.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Are you listening to me?
Yes, M.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
It doesn't quite add up.
Sabotage?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
I am. What do you want?
Excellent.
Excellent.
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Maybe. Maybe not.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
You were in hell?
Babe Brother.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Just stay in bed and rest.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
Tolerable well.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
That's nice.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
You can bring ONE toy...
Okay...
Bye, house.
What?  What is it?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Watch yourself!!
You can't!
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
Trouble?!  Where?!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
But why would Andy want me?
Hold still, Buzz!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
I can't see a thing!
She's sick!
Have you been replaced?
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
He got it, Woody!
Yes SIR!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
I can't quite make out --
Huh?
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
There's no mirror.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Home is where the heart is.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're not so old yourself!
Can you move over a wee bit?
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
H'm?
It was only a mouthful!
Did you now.
I don't know what you mean.
I can't find Manolo.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Nine thousand dollars.
Arnie, this is crazy.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Why?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Like I give a fuck.
Yes.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Then here's a little bump.
Who do you work for?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
So you pay off our customs officials?
I don't know, sir.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Not this time.
We agree.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
It was an anonymous tip.
If I can.
What is it you want me to do?
It could mean that, yes.
Noriega is a criminal.
You won't say anything to my parents?
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Thanks.
think I left something back at the -
Ssshh!
Right. You can't sleep here.
Out.
Because it's illegal.
No, not holding hands.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Unless you get caught.
Now?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
What about The Untouchables?
That's your theory?
What's wrong, Allison?
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
You're all hear.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
We're two thousand short.
Well, it's up to you.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Your favourite dish.
Yeah.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Six weeks.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
He doubts me.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
It's all I have.
What do you know of my pain?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Doctor.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Why?
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
I did not.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I'll take you to the bridge.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
No conditions.
Because you, too, must know.

You haven't told him?
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
I know, I met him.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Let's get outta here.
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
End of line.
The Pentagon?
If you think -
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Greetings, program...
Yeah, I... oops!
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Shhhhh.
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Tron...?
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
Do it!
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Why is everything...like this?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Roger, One.  Rolling.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
What?
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Yeah, but for who?							*
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
You're not going anywhere.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Yes what?
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
They must've just missed me.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
He needed my help.
No.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Do you still love your husband?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
You wouldn't believe me.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
No.  Much more.
Absolutely.
So what's your angle?
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
What about the husbands?
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
He said he was an American agent.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Yes.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Yes.  Now go.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
I'm married!
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Don't eat anything.
Ya looked through it?
Get it.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Now hang up.
And here we are.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Is that your real name? Really?
What time is it?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
How 'bout me what?
Very much. Now, where were we?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
Five.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
I don't believe so.
Thank you.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
How come?
Heard that.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Can you live with it?
You wanna get unhaunted?
I don't blame you.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
I'm her husband.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Tomorrow.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Good for you.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Where?
Two guys.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
Yeah?
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
The police department?
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
What?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Who is he?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Uh-huh.
What about him?
Where'd you come from?
Thank you.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Rock whores.
Pussy love pink rocks.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Exactly room-mates.
Do you know where we can find him?
Donowitz, he said.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
Meaning...???
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I have to go.
This is April, right?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
You're sure?
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
You... you left them a message?
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I'm here about some monkeys.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
How did you find me?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
You really want to know?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Might be tight.
You want something?
I said I was sorry.
That's 'cause he's dead.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
What do you want for free?
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Same back at you.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
Just a car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
I want my car.
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
Who the hell is this!?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
The wind isn't blowing.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
May I carry your package, Grace?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I just drove in this morning.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
Thank you.
Those are white words, not ours.
What?
Still playing?
You know what I want.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
You live pretty good.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
I wanted to talk.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Don't yell at me!
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
We're going all the way.  Together.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Just drive.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Where the hell am I going to go?
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
No.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
About things.  About your wife.
I do.
What makes you say that?
How do you put a price on murder?
Make it twenty.
I need thirteen.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
And tell her what?
Is the job done?
All I have in the world.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
That's a thick change of heart.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Come on, Jake--
Christ, Jake, please--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I've had time to get over it.
How old are you?
Not before I settle with you.
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Jesus!
I guess.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Eh?
No!
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
...And everything is nothing too.
You afraid of the dark?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Stand up.
Accident.
That's a solid name.
Would I what?
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a madman.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
You came to take my wife from me?
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
What are you talking about!
What?
You're too quick for me.
Will you shut up!
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You've been there?
What?
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Darrell.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
You should be more careful.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Those are white words, not ours.
Like you.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Still playing?
How do you know he's still not here?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You could leave him.
Try me.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
No! You get it!
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
'Cause I love you.
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
How much?
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
No baby, you got it wrong.
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Wrong number.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You didn't hear something?
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Four.
What did I say?
He's asleep.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Yes. Is this David?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Jesus.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
Rust?
Seventy-five percent.
In college. A car accident.
We've already begun.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Yes he is.
No.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Okay.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
Innocent of what?
We was... lyin'.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
Nope.
You ain't dead.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Your wife?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Uh... Duke.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
And?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
No.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Lookin' at?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Well... I don't recollect.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Yeah.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
You better get on back, Miss.
You ain't shot.
Huh?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Eleven.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Yeah.
You're marking us, Bill.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
He's dead, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Tom?
See that scrub oak yonder?
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Maybe.
Yeah?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Alright.
A glass of water would be nice.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
County. I was in for fraud.
Well, I'm sorry.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
We want to meet him.
Two hours, tops.
Which is shit.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
Kobayashi.
I know he was good.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Kobayashi.
Right.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
Why didn't you say anything?
Keaton was Keyser Soze
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Yes.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
As far as we know, nothing.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
How did you settle on the amount?
And no one will know the truth.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Through, through his book.
I'm on the staff of...
You may step down.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
Hold on a second.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
Why is that?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
It was good of you to meet...
There's nothing they can do to me.
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Right.  Who called?
Why?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
... that's perfectly all right.
No.
And ask me what?
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
How come you're calling me from...?
Missus...
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
Laura.
What...?
You're going to stay here...?
Isn't there something you...
Stop pressuring me...
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What do you want?
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Yeah.  I'm awake.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We got to talk.
I don't want a mistrial.
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Hi.  How are you doing?
Yes.
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
I -- I --
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Let me come in.
Your name. And --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Don't go.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Yes.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
How does it work?
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
You can't. You're afraid!
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
I don't know... Switzerland?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
Wander about.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Good-bye.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
I don't like them.
No birds live here.
The tall trees...
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Vaguely...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
Why? What's happened?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes?! But --
To the church, I must go there.
Please let me go.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
How long has she had the room?
Would you please go and look?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I've never run across one like that.
That's following a train of thought.
Normal.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
And she died...
Nothing to tell.
I'll take you home.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Wandering.
What is it, a still life?
How soon can it be altered?
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
I didn't hear you.
First of all...
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
You're an asshole.
I don't have to...
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You go home!
You want to hear me out?
What?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
What?
I am not flexible on this.
It has worked.
They won't figure it out.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
Don't ever stare him down.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I know...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
She's still working?
Sweet deal.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Here's his head.
I'm not talking to you?
Give me two more.
Well, I didn't mean it.
I can't.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
He's having a problem here.
He is not cracking up.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
What does that mean?
Now?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
You hate women.
What? What's your point?
They need leadership.
Government cutbacks.
Well it's bad timing.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
Who else?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I'm not. What's the problem?
So what do we do?
We're leaving in three hours.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
I love you.
Hi.
Well I do.
Well, can you come back inside?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
We're not canceling.
I won't even discuss it.
Micheal, by accident.
It's too late.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You did all right dad.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I just want her to be happy.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
I don't hear it.
The wahoo moment?
Yup.
How do you know she's dead.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Greenpeace?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
Okay great. What will that be?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
The stone age.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
You'd like me to kill them?
Yes, yes.
It's a present from my parents.
What's that?
No.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Don't you ever see him?
How could anybody behave like that?
Evil.
Whatever you like.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Fifteen yards.
And in the vegetable plot?
You're happy, aren't you!
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
She's left.
No.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Very, very?
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
But, miss ...
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Today, a good girl.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
But only you will know he's not human.
He was a computer program for crissake.
I'm getting by.
What about them?
I've seen worse.
Their weapons missing?
Then I guess we're even.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
I understand... I understand perfectly.
This is supposed to be years away.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
Help me get out of here.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
What you need is a collar.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I'm still working on it.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Start of what?
You like baseball?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
Thanks.
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
What are you talking about?
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
For Schumann.
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
What can it hurt is they offend me.
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
What'd ya think?
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What rig?
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
What's it gonna cost?
Who would find out?
The American "people"?
Who's gonna tell'em.
...<u>nothing</u>...
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
...this's <u>good</u>...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Knock on wood.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
...they just hadn't thought it through...
The War is Over.
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
To preserve their Way of Life.
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
The...
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Might, if I was asked...
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Why not?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Watch me.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
...they... <u>you</u> know...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
...gotta read my reports.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Then get out and close it behind you.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see...
About what?
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
You speak for me, son.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
We are?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...I can't make it tonight.
Dump it.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
Well, why stop at that?
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...how do you know? You wish...
Oh Christ!
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
It's over you, Gordon.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
With Mark?
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Hi
Hmm.
Thank you Jenkins
Jenkins!
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
They seemed, closing by much
Sell my soul?
Mom.
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
A ghost?
Do you really think so?
You're joking.
How do you know it's a she?
Fine.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Have you been hurt?
You were in an accident?
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Who's that?
Thank you.
What?
No.  No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
...just so she could cut them off.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Good.  I'm good.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Yep.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Jody, no...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Shhh.
M-E...
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Hartford?
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I know.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Don't.
Nice.  Almost done.
Fine.
I know.
That's not what I'm sug--
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
That's...
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
I...
In the living room...
But I don't remember.
Yes.  The ghost.
...Please stop...
STOP IT!
What?
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
You should have tried harder.
Get out of my way.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Huh.
Don't think so.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
MADISON!
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Well, they are.
Two what...?
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Michael, Rowan should -
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
Better than most, I suppose.
She didn't feel them
'He'...?
Anybody got a BP yet...?
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Like this...?
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
But have I...?  Ever...?!
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
You still feel that crazy...?
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Captain's orders.
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Mad. for each other.
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Mm-hmm...
Talking to me dear...?
Your beneficence.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Just don't fall off any ladders.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
I really don't know what to say
I'm sorry?
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
I don't know...
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Open it...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
He doesn't need to...
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Yes I can...
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
At home alone - where were you?
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
Were you always this sick?
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Not ever. Never.
What is it now?
Dead?
Take a whiff of heaven.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
Let me get this straight...
God, I love being dead.
Yeah?
But that smile.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Of course we are.
...not the pit.
Watch your tone, mister.
I will not have my boys arguing.
They're in the ignition, silly.
Got it.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
My room?
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Me-ow.
Your article sucked.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Interesting.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
I know.
But you never do.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Well? Where the hell are you?
That's hard to believe.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
I'll make you very proud.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Tipping?
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
What kind of ideas?
That's perfect.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
Eat a power bar.
And where might that be?
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
The skinny brunette.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Where's this coming from?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Your Honor... Please...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
What?
Yeah, but...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Nothing.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I'm not on your property!
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
About six and a half million dollars.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
And you believe her?
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
You can't...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
And she wanted to talk.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Goodbye, Sandra.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Put them all together and what do we have?
You need that real often?
I'll work on it.
Is this leading somewhere?
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Hey, I tried the board.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
It's not a guy...
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Where have you been?
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I don't like to lose, either.
You tell me.
Would that include me?
Private train?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
On my way to Denver...
I deal with some tough customers.
He had a pressing engagement.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Who was this partner of his?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Then come with us.
Me?
What is Tir Asleen?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Why not?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
I have no family.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
Are you a warrior?
I will.
Where the hell did you come from?
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
You?
Willow!
Well what did she say?
Want me to carry Elora?
Absolutely not.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Shhhhh!
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
He never misses.
Shut up.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Who is he?
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
The sorceress.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
John, I don't understand any of this.
John, why?...
Yes, sir.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
What?
I'm going this morning.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
There was.
I know.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Wrong.
I admit I don't know where he is.
He's got my number.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Yes, thank you very much.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
They don't have any shit.
All right, where is he?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
If any!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Who are you?
You are?
I don't believe you!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Catch him, you fool!
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Why --
Uh-huh.
Has it poppies on the wall....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
No --
Well, you're perfect now.
What sort of an animal is that?
I knew you would!
Look -- it ticks!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
But why?  Why?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
To Oz?
What?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Yes --- there.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh --
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Who at?
Yeah. Me?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Now...
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Yeah --
You mean she bit you?
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
We'll get you together!
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, no!
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
Well, I --
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Elektra King.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
We cant.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
...you should rest.
No. Youll be safe here.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
You can drop the act, its over.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
Soon shell be everywhere.
Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
How appropriate.
Your father...
Is it?
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Hello, Adrian.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Mm hmm.
Collect me?
Jon, no -- I can't --
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
What if you¹re wrong??
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
His . . . whatever.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Memory lane.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
I think he's going to the john.
Where did he go?
Those cars.  What year is this??
Coward.  Giving up.
-- What?
I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names!
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Ever see one of these before?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
We're not after car thieves here.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Yes it does.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
That's exactly why we need them.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Naturally.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What do you get if you finish?
Yorgi asked me to.
Go to hell.
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
I'm from L.A.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
You don't have to do that.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
I thought that was in detail.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Is this what you're looking for?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Of course.
You wanna see my politics?
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
For what purpose?
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
It's too far.
I wanted to talk to you.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What if I like the pain?
Suit yourself.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I've seen a lot of rings.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
To find Rogue.
I'll go.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Now wait a minute!
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
I did, sir.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Well... yes.
I promise.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Goodbye, darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
Yes, just the two.
I beg your pardon?
What wockers?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What?
Must be the music room.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
You've got it, master.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
It wasn't me.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
I'm not trying to be funny.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Can you play it?
That's what we're paid for.
It's the only way.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Yes!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Stop -- singing!!!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
